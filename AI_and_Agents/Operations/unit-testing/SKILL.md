# Unit Testing

## Purpose
Write effective unit tests using FIRST principles, AAA pattern, test doubles, and TDD. Ensure test quality, maintainability, and meaningful coverage of business logic. This skill covers test architecture, isolation strategies, mock/stub decisions, CI integration, and test suite health monitoring.

## Agent Protocol

### Trigger
User mentions unit testing, test doubles, mocking, stubbing, TDD, FIRST principles, code coverage, test structure (AAA), or unit test patterns.

### Input Context
- Modules or functions under test
- Dependency graph and injection points
- Existing test suite structure
- Coverage targets and CI constraints
- Language and test framework in use

### Output Artifact
Unit test suite with proper isolation, test doubles, and CI integration.

### Response Format
Test file(s) with:
1. Proper AAA structure and descriptive naming
2. Mock/stub/fake definitions at system boundaries
3. Coverage configuration and CI pipeline integration
4. Test organization strategy (co-located or centralized)

### Completion Criteria
- All identified functions have unit tests covering happy path, error paths, and edge cases
- Test doubles used only at system boundaries
- Tests are fast (< 100ms per test, < 5 min for suite)
- Coverage meets agreed thresholds (line > 80%, branch > 70%)
- CI integration configured with coverage reporting and sharding

## Workflow

1. **Analyze the unit**: Identify the function/module, its dependencies, and its observable behavior (not implementation)
2. **Determine isolation needs**: Map dependencies to test double types (mock at boundaries, real for pure functions)
3. **Design test scenarios**: List happy path, error paths, edge cases (empty, null, boundary values)
4. **Create test structure**: Write describe blocks for organization, it blocks per scenario following AAA/Given-When-Then
5. **Implement mocks**: Configure mock responses at dependency boundaries. Use vi.mock/jest.mock for module mocks, vi.spyOn for method spies
6. **Write assertions**: Assert observable behavior (return values, state changes, side effects). Avoid asserting internal implementation
7. **Run and verify**: Execute tests. Verify coverage meets thresholds. Check test execution time
8. **Refactor tests**: Improve test code quality, remove duplication, extract test helpers and factories
9. **Integrate CI**: Configure CI with parallel execution, sharding, coverage reporting, and quality gates
10. **Monitor suite health**: Track execution time, flakiness, coverage stability. Fix flaky tests immediately

## Architecture / Decision Trees

### Test Double Selection

```
Dependency type?
├── External HTTP/network → Mock (MSW/WireMock)
├── Database → Fake (in-memory repo) or Mock at repository boundary
├── File system → Mock (memfs) or in-memory implementation
├── Time (Date, setTimeout) → Fake timers (vi.useFakeTimers)
├── Random/UUID → Stub with fixed values
├── Logger → Stub (no-op or spy)
├── Pure function → Real implementation
└── Internal service → Real implementation or Spy
```

### Framework Selection

```
Project language?
├── TypeScript/JavaScript
│   ├── New project + ESM → Vitest
│   └── Existing Jest → Jest
├── Java → JUnit 5 + Mockito
├── Python → pytest + pytest-mock
├── Go → testing + testify
├── Rust → cargo test
└── C# → xUnit + Moq/NSubstitute
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-mocking**: Mocking internal details creates brittle tests that break on refactoring. Mock only at module/system boundaries
2. **Testing implementation, not behavior**: Tests that assert internal method calls or private state break during refactoring
3. **Shared mutable state across tests**: Tests that depend on earlier tests' side effects are unreliable and order-dependent
4. **Slow tests**: Tests using real databases, network calls, or filesystem are integration tests, not unit tests
5. **Mocking dependencies you don't own**: Mocking third-party library internals creates tight coupling to library details
6. **Empty assertions**: Tests without proper assertions (expect(true).toBe(true)) provide false confidence
7. **Brittle string matching**: Asserting exact error messages or rendered output makes tests fragile
8. **Granularity mismatch**: Testing too large (entire service) or too small (private helpers) a unit
9. **Skipping error paths**: Only testing the happy path misses the majority of potential bugs
10. **Coverage chasing**: Targeting 100% coverage encourages meaningless tests. Focus on business logic

## Best Practices

1. Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) consistently across all tests
2. Use descriptive test names: "should [expected] when [scenario]"
3. Mock at system boundaries (network, persistence, time), not implementation internals
4. Use real implementations for pure functions and value objects
5. Keep tests fast: mock I/O, use in-memory dependencies, avoid real timers
6. One assertion concept per test — multiple assertions are fine if they test one behavior
7. Use factory functions for test data creation with sensible defaults and overrides
8. Clean up after tests: restore mocks, reset timers, clear state
9. Write tests alongside or before production code (TDD) for complex logic
10. Run tests in watch mode during development for fast feedback

## Compared With

| Aspect | Unit Testing | Integration Testing | E2E Testing |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Scope | Single function/module | Component interactions | Full user workflows |
| Isolation | Full (mocked deps) | Partial (real deps) | None (real system) |
| Speed | Milliseconds | Seconds | Minutes |
| Debugging | Easy (isolated) | Medium | Hard |
| Brittleness | Low | Medium | High |
| Confidence | Low (isolated) | Medium | High |
| When | Every commit | On feature completion | Pre-release |

## Performance Considerations

- Individual tests should complete in < 100ms; suites under 5 minutes
- Mock I/O to reduce test time from seconds to microseconds
- Use test sharding in CI to parallelize across workers
- Configure `mockReset` and `restoreMocks` for automatic cleanup
- Use `it.concurrent` for independent tests within the same describe block
- Avoid beforeEach/afterEach for expensive setup — use beforeAll/afterAll for shared resources
- Watch mode skips unchanged files for fast feedback during development

## Unit Test Examples

### TypeScript/Vitest — Service with Dependency Injection
```typescript
// src/services/order.service.ts
export class OrderService {
  constructor(
    private orderRepo: OrderRepository,
    private paymentGateway: PaymentGateway,
    private emailService: EmailService,
  ) {}

  async placeOrder(cart: Cart, customerId: string): Promise<Order> {
    const total = cart.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
    const payment = await this.paymentGateway.charge(customerId, total);
    const order = await this.orderRepo.create({ customerId, total, paymentId: payment.id });
    await this.emailService.sendOrderConfirmation(customerId, order.id);
    return order;
  }
}

// src/services/__tests__/order.service.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach } from "vitest";
import { OrderService } from "../order.service";

describe("OrderService", () => {
  let service: OrderService;
  let mockOrderRepo: OrderRepository;
  let mockPaymentGateway: PaymentGateway;
  let mockEmailService: EmailService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    mockOrderRepo = { create: vi.fn() };
    mockPaymentGateway = { charge: vi.fn() };
    mockEmailService = { sendOrderConfirmation: vi.fn() };
    service = new OrderService(mockOrderRepo, mockPaymentGateway, mockEmailService);
  });

  it("should create order and charge payment when placing order", async () => {
    const cart = { items: [{ price: 50 }, { price: 30 }] };
    mockPaymentGateway.charge.mockResolvedValue({ id: "pay_123" });
    mockOrderRepo.create.mockResolvedValue({ id: "ord_456" });

    const result = await service.placeOrder(cart, "cust_789");

    expect(mockPaymentGateway.charge).toHaveBeenCalledWith("cust_789", 80);
    expect(mockOrderRepo.create).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      customerId: "cust_789",
      total: 80,
      paymentId: "pay_123",
    });
    expect(mockEmailService.sendOrderConfirmation).toHaveBeenCalledWith("cust_789", "ord_456");
    expect(result).toEqual({ id: "ord_456" });
  });

  it("should not create order when payment fails", async () => {
    const cart = { items: [{ price: 50 }] };
    mockPaymentGateway.charge.mockRejectedValue(new Error("insufficient_funds"));

    await expect(service.placeOrder(cart, "cust_789")).rejects.toThrow("insufficient_funds");
    expect(mockOrderRepo.create).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(mockEmailService.sendOrderConfirmation).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

### Python/pytest — Pure Function Testing
```python
# src/pricing.py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from decimal import Decimal

@dataclass
class PriceBreak:
    quantity: int
    discount_percent: Decimal

def calculate_discount(quantity: int, breaks: list[PriceBreak]) -> Decimal:
    applicable = [b for b in breaks if quantity >= b.quantity]
    if not applicable:
        return Decimal("0")
    return max(applicable, key=lambda b: b.discount_percent).discount_percent

def calculate_total(items: list[dict], discount_pct: Decimal) -> Decimal:
    subtotal = sum(Decimal(str(item["price"])) * item["quantity"] for item in items)
    discount = subtotal * (discount_pct / Decimal("100"))
    return subtotal - discount

# tests/test_pricing.py
import pytest

from src.pricing import calculate_discount, calculate_total, PriceBreak

class TestCalculateDiscount:
    def test_no_breaks_returns_zero(self):
        assert calculate_discount(10, []) == Decimal("0")

    def test_quantity_meets_single_break(self):
        breaks = [PriceBreak(5, Decimal("10"))]
        assert calculate_discount(5, breaks) == Decimal("10")

    def test_quantity_exceeds_break(self):

        ]
        assert calculate_discount(15, breaks) == Decimal("15")

    @patch("src.order_service.EmailService")
    @patch("src.order_service.PaymentGateway")
    @patch("src.order_service.OrderRepository")
    def test_place_order_success(

        mock_payment_cls.return_value = mock_payment
        mock_email_cls.return_value = mock_email

        service = OrderService()
        mock_payment.charge.return_value = {"id": "pay_123"}
        mock_repo.create.return_value = {"id": "ord_456"}

        cart = {"items": [{"price": "50.00", "quantity": 1}]}
        result = service.place_order(cart, "cust_789")

        assert result["id"] == "ord_456"
        mock_payment.charge.assert_called_once()
        mock_repo.create.assert_called_once()
        mock_email.send_confirmation.assert_called_once()
```

## Unit Testing Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Over-Mocking
Mocking every dependency including pure functions and internal collaborators creates brittle tests that break during refactoring. Only mock at system boundaries (network, filesystem, time, RNG). Use real implementations for value objects, pure functions, and internal helpers.

### Anti-Pattern: Testing Private Methods
Testing private methods directly couples tests to implementation details. Private methods change during refactoring while public behavior stays the same. Test through the public interface only. If a private method has complex logic, extract it to a separate module and test it as a public function.

### Anti-Pattern: Shared Mutable State
Tests that share mutable state through module-level variables or test fixtures with side effects produce order-dependent failures. Each test must be independently runnable. Use `beforeEach` to create fresh instances. Never modify shared state in a test.

### Anti-Pattern: Asserting Implementation Details
Asserting that a specific method was called internally or that a specific property exists on an object. These assertions break during refactoring. Assert only on observable behavior: return values, thrown exceptions, and side effects visible to the caller.

### Anti-Pattern: Empty or Trivial Tests
Tests that call a function but don't assert anything, or assert tautologies like `expect(true).toBe(true)`. Every test must assert at least one meaningful outcome. If a test passes without any real assertion, it provides false confidence.

### Anti-Pattern: Ignoring Edge Cases
Testing only the happy path (correct input, expected behavior) misses null/undefined inputs, boundary values, empty collections, and error conditions. Every function should have tests for: normal input, boundary values, invalid input, empty/null input, and error conditions.

## Unit Testing Maturity Model

| Level | Characteristics | Practices |
|---|---|---|
| 1: Initial | No or minimal unit tests | Manual testing only, no test framework, no CI integration |
| 2: Defined | Basic coverage for critical logic | Tests for core business logic, basic mock usage, some CI integration |
| 3: Managed | Systematic unit testing | AAA pattern, proper test doubles at boundaries, >70% coverage, CI gates, test naming conventions |
| 4: Measured | Test-driven quality culture | TDD for complex logic, property-based testing supplement, <100ms per test, flakiness < 0.1% |
| 5: Optimized | Self-healing test suite | Mutation testing for quality validation, AI-assisted test generation, automatic test maintenance, coverage-based risk assessment |

## Performance Considerations

- Individual test execution: target < 100ms. Tests slower than 100ms need investigation.
- Suite execution: target < 5 minutes for full unit suite. Use sharding for parallel execution in CI.
- Mock setup overhead: vi.mock/jest.mock adds 1-5ms per mocked module. Minimize module-level mocks.
- Test data creation: factory functions should complete in < 10ms. Avoid database writes in factories.
- Coverage computation: adds 2x-3x execution time. Run with coverage only in CI, not in watch mode.
- File watcher: < 500ms reload time for watch mode. Large projects may need test file filters.

## Rules
1. Every test must follow AAA or Given-When-Then structure — no unstructured test bodies
2. Mock only at system boundaries (network, persistence, filesystem, time). Internal dependencies use real implementations
3. Tests must not share mutable state — each test must be independently runnable and order-independent
4. Test names must describe behavior, not implementation: `should return sorted array when called with unsorted input`
5. Each test must assert at least one observable outcome — no assertions-only-in-catch or empty tests
6. Coverage thresholds: line >= 80%, branch >= 70% for business logic code. Exclude generated code
7. No test may make real network calls, access real databases, or write to the real filesystem outside temp
8. Time-dependent code must use fake timers (vi.useFakeTimers) for deterministic execution
9. All mocks must be reset between tests (use mockReset: true in config or afterEach restoreAllMocks)
10. Skipped tests (it.skip) must not be committed — use test.todo for planned tests instead
11. At least one negative/error test must accompany every positive/happy path test
12. Test data must use factories or fixtures with sensible defaults — no copy-pasted test data
13. PRs must not decrease coverage below configured thresholds without documented exception
14. Flaky tests (non-deterministic failures) must be quarantined within 24 hours and fixed within one sprint
15. Private methods are tested only through public interface — never expose privates for testing
16. Test files must be co-located with source files for unit tests, centralized for integration/E2E
17. Watch mode defaults to changed files only for fast feedback during development
18. Console.log assertions in tests must be removed before committing — use spy on console

## Handoff
After unit testing, hand off to:
- `quality-integration-testing` — for verifying component interactions with real dependencies
- `quality-property-based-testing` — for adding property-based invariants to complement examples
- `quality-regression-testing` — for regression suite execution and maintenance
- `quality-smoke-testing` — for BVT smoke test definition on tested components
## Implementation Patterns

### Observer Pattern for Event Handling
`
interface EventObserver<T> {
  onEvent(event: T): Promise<void>;
}

class EventBus<T> {
  private observers: Set<EventObserver<T>> = new Set();
  subscribe(observer: EventObserver<T>): void {
    this.observers.add(observer);
  }
  unsubscribe(observer: EventObserver<T>): void {
    this.observers.delete(observer);
  }
  async emit(event: T): Promise<void> {
    const results = Array.from(this.observers).map(o => o.onEvent(event));
    await Promise.allSettled(results);
  }
}
`

### Configuration-Driven Approach
`
config:
  defaults:
    timeout: 30s
    retryCount: 3
  overrides:
    production:
      timeout: 60s
      retryCount: 5
    development:
      timeout: 300s
      retryCount: 1
`

## Production Considerations

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Configuration validated against schema before startup
- [ ] Health check endpoints registered and monitored
- [ ] Graceful shutdown with draining period (30s timeout)
- [ ] Resource limits configured (CPU, memory, file descriptors)
- [ ] Log level set appropriate for environment
- [ ] Metrics endpoint secured and exposed
- [ ] Rate limiting configured per-tier
- [ ] TLS certificates valid and auto-renewing
- [ ] Database migrations run as separate deployment step
- [ ] Feature flags ready for gradual rollout

### Monitoring and Alerting
| Metric | Threshold | Severity | Action |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Error rate | > 1% over 5min | Critical | Page on-call |
| p99 latency | > 2s over 5min | Warning | Investigate |
| Throughput drop | > 50% over 1min | Critical | Check upstream |
| Queue depth | > 1000 over 1min | Warning | Scale consumers |
| Disk usage | > 85% | Warning | Clean or expand |
| Memory usage | > 90% heap | Critical | Restart or scale |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Solution |
|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Premature optimization | Complex code for no measured benefit | Guessing instead of profiling | Measure first, optimize based on data |
| Copy-paste reuse | Duplicate code across codebase | Lack of abstraction | Extract shared logic into libraries |
| Gold-plating | Features with no current requirement | Over-engineering | YAGNI — build what's needed now |
| Magical thinking | Assumptions without validation | Skipping error handling | Handle all failure modes explicitly |

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
Cache hierarchy: L1 (in-memory local) → L2 (distributed Redis/Memcached) → L3 (CDN/Edge).
Cache invalidation: TTL-based (simple, stale), event-based (complex, fresh), write-through (consistent, higher write latency), write-behind (fast writes, eventual consistency).

### Resource Pooling
- Database connections: Pool of reusable connections (HikariCP, pgBouncer)
- HTTP connections: Keep-alive + connection pooling for external calls
- Thread pool: Bounded thread pools for async task execution

### Profiling Methodology
1. Establish baseline with production traffic profile
2. Profile CPU with sampling profiler (pprof, perf, async-profiler)
3. Profile memory with heap dumps and allocation tracking
4. Profile I/O with strace/perf trace for syscall analysis
5. Profile latency with distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
6. Identify bottleneck, formulate hypothesis, implement fix
7. Re-profile to verify improvement, repeat

## Security Considerations

### Threat Modeling (STRIDE)
- Spoofing: Identity validation, authentication
- Tampering: Integrity checks, digital signatures
- Repudiation: Audit logs, non-repudiation
- Information disclosure: Encryption, access control
- Denial of service: Rate limiting, resource quotas
- Elevation of privilege: Principle of least privilege

### Supply Chain Security
- Dependency scanning: Snyk, Dependabot, Trivy
- SBOM generation: CycloneDX or SPDX format
- Signed commits: GPG or SSH commit signing
- Artifact verification: Checksum validation, signature verification

### Secrets Management
- Secrets never in code — always in secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Rotation policy: Rotate database credentials every 90 days
- Access audit: Log every secrets access, alert on anomalies
- Encryption at rest and in transit for all secrets
- Principle of least privilege: each service gets only its own secrets

## Rules
- Default-deny security posture — allow only explicitly required access.
- All inputs validated, all outputs encoded, all errors handled.
- Defend in depth — multiple layers of security controls.
- Fail securely — errors default to safe behavior.
- Log security-relevant events for audit and investigation.
- Keep dependencies updated — automate vulnerability scanning.
- Design for observability from day one, not as an afterthought.
- Document all architectural decisions with rationale.
- Review code for security, performance, and correctness before merging.
## Architecture Decision Trees

### Unit Test Approach
| Decision Point | Option A | Option B | Decision Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Test framework | Jest (JS/TS ecosystem) | Vitest (faster, ESM-native) | Framework maturity, ESM compatibility |
| Assertion style | expect(x).toBe(y) (readable) | assert.equal(x, y) (minimal) | Team preference, existing codebase |
| Mocking style | Jest mocks (built-in) | ts-mockito/typed-mock | Type safety, TypeScript usage |
| Coverage tool | Built-in (Jest Istanbul) | c8 (modern, ESM-friendly) | Coverage needs, configuration complexity |

### What to Unit Test
- Business logic → Pure functions, complex algorithms
- Data transformations → Mappers, serializers, validators
- Edge cases → Empty states, boundary values, error conditions
- NOT trivial → Simple getters/setters, framework wiring
