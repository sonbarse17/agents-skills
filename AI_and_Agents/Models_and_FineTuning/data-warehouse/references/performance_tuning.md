# Performance Tuning for Data Data Warehouse

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Performance Tuning**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **CAP Theorem Trade-offs**: Balances Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
- **Star Schema Design**: Denormalizes tables to minimize join operations.
- **Resilient Distributed Datasets**: Achieves fault tolerance through deterministic lineage graphs.
- **Columnar Storage (Parquet/ORC)**: Drastically reduces disk I/O through projection pushdown.
- **Data Mesh Paradigm**: Decentralizes ownership into domain-oriented data products.

### Core Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE iceberg_catalog.db.sales (
    id BIGINT,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    event_time TIMESTAMP
) USING iceberg
PARTITIONED BY (days(event_time));
```

              .reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b) \
