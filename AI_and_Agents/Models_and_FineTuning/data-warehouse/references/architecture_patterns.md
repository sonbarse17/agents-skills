# Architecture Patterns for Data Data Warehouse

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Architecture Patterns**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Data Mesh Paradigm**: Decentralizes ownership into domain-oriented data products.
- **Idempotent Operations**: Guarantees safe retries during distributed pipeline failures.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Employs background anti-entropy for synchronization.
- **ACID Transactions on Object Storage**: Leverages Apache Iceberg for concurrent schema evolution.
- **CAP Theorem Trade-offs**: Balances Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

### Core Implementation

```python
def process_rdd(rdd):
    # Perform complex distributed transformations
    return rdd.filter(lambda x: x['status'] == 'ACTIVE') \
              .map(lambda x: (x['user_id'], x['amount'])) \
              .reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b) \
              .filter(lambda x: x[1] > 1000)
```
