# Troubleshooting Guide for Data Data Warehouse

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Troubleshooting Guide**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Exactly-once Semantics**: Utilizes Chandy-Lamport distributed snapshots.
- **Parallel Processing**: Aligns consumer threads with partition counts to maximize throughput.
- **Data Quality Assertions**: Prevents pipeline corruption via schema validation.
- **Backpressure Mechanisms**: Propagates limits upstream to prevent OutOfMemory crashes.

### Core Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE iceberg_catalog.db.sales (
    id BIGINT,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    event_time TIMESTAMP
) USING iceberg
PARTITIONED BY (days(event_time));
```
