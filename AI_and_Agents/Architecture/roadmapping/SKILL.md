# Strategic Roadmapping

## Purpose
Create, communicate, and execute strategic roadmaps that align technology initiatives with business outcomes. Apply prioritization frameworks, connect work to OKRs, manage stakeholder expectations, and plan timelines that balance innovation with delivery.

## Workflow

### Strategic Roadmapping Process
```
Vision & Strategy → Strategic Themes → Initiatives → Priorities → Timeline → Communicate → Review
                                          │                           │
                                          └── OKR Linkage ────────────┘
```

### Roadmap Horizon Model

| Horizon | Timeframe | Focus | Certainty | Audience |
|---------|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Now | 0-3 months | Current initiatives, committed deliverables | High | Engineering, stakeholders |
| Next | 3-6 months | Next priority batch, in refinement | Medium | Product teams, leadership |
| Later | 6-12 months | Strategic bets, exploratory | Low | Leadership, strategy |
| Future | 12+ months | Vision, industry trends, moonshots | Very low | Executive, board |

## Strategic Roadmapping Frameworks

### Framework 1: Now-Next-Later (Productboard, Aha!)

The most common modern roadmapping framework. Focuses on themes and outcomes rather than dates and features.

```
NOW (Q2 2026)                    NEXT (Q3 2026)                  LATER (Q4 2026-H1 2027)
├── Platform Stability           ├── API Marketplace              ├── AI-Powered Analytics
│   ├── Multi-region deploy      │   ├── Partner onboarding       │   ├── Predictive insights
│   ├── P99 < 200ms              │   ├── Usage-based billing      │   ├── Anomaly detection
│   └── 99.99% uptime            │   └── API catalog              │   └── Recommendations
├── Developer Experience         ├── Mobile SDK Suite             ├── Global Expansion

    └── RBAC                         └── SLA reporting                └── Revenue sharing
```

### Framework 2: Outcome-Driven Roadmap (Inspired by Marty Cagan)

Focus on outcomes (business results, customer behaviors) rather than output (features shipped).

```
OUTCOME: Reduce time-to-first-value from 5 days to 1 hour
├── Hypothesis: Interactive onboarding reduces drop-off
│   └── Initiative: Self-service guided tutorial
│       ├── Success metric: % of signups completing tutorial
│       └── Target: 80% completion rate
├── Hypothesis: SDK availability increases activation
│   └── Initiative: Quickstart SDKs for 5 languages
│       ├── Success metric: Time from signup to first API call
│       └── Target: < 5 minutes
└── Hypothesis: Sandbox environment increases confidence
    └── Initiative: One-click sandbox provisioning
        ├── Success metric: % of signups using sandbox
        └── Target: 60% engagement
```

### Framework 3: Capability-Based Roadmap

Organize around building platform capabilities rather than features.

```
CAPABILITY: Developer Self-Service
├── Q2: API key self-service portal
├── Q3: Usage analytics dashboard
├── Q4: Billing and plan management
└── Q1 2027: Team management and RBAC

CAPABILITY: API Reliability
├── Q2: Multi-region active-active
├── Q3: Automated failover
|── Q4: SLA dashboard for consumers
└── Q1 2027: Chaos engineering program

CAPABILITY: API Ecosystem
├── Q2: Public changelog and status page
├── Q3: Partner integration marketplace
├── Q4: Revenue sharing platform
└── Q1 2027: Developer community forum
```

### Framework 4: Lean Canvas Roadmap

Validates riskiest assumptions first:

```
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6): RISKIEST ASSUMPTION
  → "Developers will adopt our API if it has TypeScript SDK"
  → Build: Minimal TypeScript SDK + 5 reference integrations
  → Validate: 10 developer interviews, adoption analytics

Phase 2 (Weeks 7-12): NEXT RISKIEST
  → "Enterprises will pay for SLA-backed API access"
  → Build: Enterprise tier with uptime monitoring
  → Validate: 5 enterprise pilot customers

Phase 3 (Weeks 13-18): SCALE
  → Build: Self-service portal, Python/Go SDKs
  → Validate: Organic signup funnel metrics
```

## Prioritization Models

### RICE Framework
| Factor | Definition | Scoring |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Reach | How many users/consumers will this impact? | # of users per time period |
| Impact | How much will this move the needle? | 0.25x (minimal) to 3x (massive) |
| Confidence | How confident are we in our estimates? | 20% (wild guess) to 100% (proven) |
| Effort | How much work is required? | Person-months or story points |

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

```yaml
initiative: API TypeScript SDK
  reach: 5000 developers/month
  impact: 2x (high — reduces integration time)
  confidence: 80% (validated by developer interviews)
  effort: 3 person-months
  rice_score: (5000 × 2 × 0.8) / 3 = 2667

initiative: Multi-region deployment
  reach: 2000 active consumers
  impact: 1.5x (medium — improves reliability)
  confidence: 60% (we know we need it, unclear ROI)
  effort: 6 person-months
  rice_score: (2000 × 1.5 × 0.6) / 6 = 300
```

### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)

Used in SAFe for prioritizing jobs by dividing value by duration.

```
WSJF = (User-Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement) / Job Size
```

```yaml
initiative: API version v3 migration
  user_value: 8   (major DX improvement)
  time_criticality: 6 (v2 sunset deadline approaching)
  risk_reduction: 5 (security improvements in v3)
  job_size: 5 (5 sprints)
  wsJF: (8 + 6 + 5) / 5 = 3.8

initiative: Developer portal redesign
  user_value: 5 (nice-to-have improvement)
  time_criticality: 2 (no deadline)
  risk_reduction: 2 (cosmetic)
  job_size: 8 (8 sprints)
  wsjf: (5 + 2 + 2) / 8 = 1.125
```

### MoSCoW Method
| Priority | Meaning | % of Effort | Criteria |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| Must have | Non-negotiable for launch | 60% | Legal, security, core functionality |
| Should have | Important but not critical | 20% | Significant value, workaround exists |
| Could have | Desirable but not necessary | 20% | Nice-to-have, low effort |
| Won't have | Explicitly out of scope | 0% | Deliberately excluded for now |

### Eisenhower Matrix for Roadmap Items
```
                    URGENT                    NOT URGENT

## OKR Linkage

### Connecting Initiatives to OKRs

Every roadmap initiative should trace to an Objective and Key Result.

```yaml
Objective: Establish market-leading API developer experience

Key Results:
  KR1: Reduce time-to-first-call from 15 min to 3 min
  KR2: Increase developer NPS from 32 to 55
  KR3: Achieve 90% documentation satisfaction rating
  KR4: Publish SDKs for 5 most requested languages

Initiatives → KR Mapping:
  - Self-service developer portal    → KR1, KR2
  - Interactive API documentation    → KR3
  - TypeScript/Python/Go SDKs        → KR1, KR4
  - Automated onboarding email flow  → KR1
  - Developer community forum        → KR2
```

### OKR Cascade
```
Company OKR (CEO)
└── Product OKRs (VP Product)
    └── Platform OKRs (Platform Team)
        └── Individual OKRs (Engineer)
```

```yaml
Company OKR:
  O: Become the leading payment processing platform
  KR: $50M API revenue; 1000 active platform partners

Product OKR:
  O: Deliver the most developer-friendly payment API
  KR1: Reduce integration time by 60%
  KR2: Launch partner marketplace with 20 integrations
  KR3: Achieve 99.99% API uptime

Platform Team OKR:
  O: Build scalable, reliable API platform
  KR1: Reduce P99 latency from 500ms to 100ms
  KR2: Achieve 99.99% uptime (zero unplanned downtime)
  KR3: Support 5000 concurrent API consumers

Engineering OKR (Individual):
  O: Improve API reliability infrastructure
  KR1: Implement multi-region active-active
  KR2: Build automated failover testing framework
  KR3: Reduce MTTR from 30 min to 5 min
```

### OKR Health Check
```python
class OKRHealthCheck:
    def check_progress(self, okrs: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
        """Check OKR health and flag at-risk items."""
        results = []
        for okr in okrs:
            status = "on_track"
            risks = []

            for kr in okr["key_results"]:
                progress = kr["current"] / kr["target"] * 100 if kr["target"] > 0 else 0

                if progress < kr["expected_progress"] * 0.7:
                    status = "at_risk"
                    risks.append(f"{kr['name']}: {progress:.0f}% vs expected {kr['expected_progress']:.0f}%")
                elif progress < kr["expected_progress"] * 0.9:
                    if status != "at_risk":
                        status = "needs_attention"

            results.append({
                "objective": okr["objective"],
                "status": status,
                "risks": risks,
                "recommended_action": self.recommend_action(status, risks),
            })
        return results
```

## Stakeholder Alignment

### Stakeholder Map
```yaml
stakeholder_mapping:
  - role: VP Product
    interest: high
    influence: high
    engagement: executive sponsor, quarterly roadmap reviews
    concerns: revenue growth, competitive position, time-to-market

  - role: Engineering Director
    interest: high
    influence: high
    engagement: biweekly roadmap sync
    concerns: technical feasibility, resource allocation, tech debt

  - role: Developer Advocate
    interest: high
    influence: medium
    engagement: weekly input session
    concerns: developer experience, documentation quality

  - role: Sales Team
    interest: medium
    influence: medium
    engagement: monthly roadmap preview
    concerns: customer commitments, competitive features

  - role: Customers
    interest: high
    influence: low (direct)
    engagement: quarterly product advisory board
    concerns: API stability, missing features, migration effort
```

### Alignment Techniques

#### Pre-Meeting One-on-Ones
```
Before any roadmap review meeting:
1. Meet individually with each key stakeholder
2. Understand their priorities and concerns
3. Address objections before the group meeting
4. Build allies who will support the proposal
5. Prepare contingency for unexpected feedback
```

#### Roadmap Review Meeting Structure
```yaml
roadmap_review:
  cadence: monthly
  duration: 60 min
  attendees: [PM, Engineering Lead, Design Lead, Stakeholders]

  agenda:
    - 5 min: Context (OKR progress, market changes)
    - 10 min: Now — what we're shipping this month
    - 15 min: Next — priorities for next quarter
    - 15 min: Later — strategic bets, decision required
    - 10 min: Trade-off discussion (what we're saying no to)
    - 5 min: Decisions and action items
```

#### Trade-off Visual
```yaml
Current trade-off:
  Invest 3 engineers for 6 months to:
  ✅ Launch multi-region active-active (P0 — SLO requirement)
  ✅ Reduce P99 latency from 500ms to 100ms (KR target)
  ❌ Delay developer portal v2 (moved to Q3)
  ❌ Defer Python SDK improvements (moved to Q3)
  ⚠️ Team capacity fully allocated — no new work without descoping
```

## Timeline Planning

### Planning Horizons
```yaml
planning_horizons:
  strategic: 12-24 months
    detail: initiative-level, outcome-focused
    owner: CPO / VP Product

### Buffer and Risk Planning
```yaml
capacity_buffer:
  planned_work: 60%
  known_unknowns: 20%     # Refinement, unexpected complexity
  pure_buffer: 20%         # Unplanned work, incidents, tech debt

risk_register:
  - risk: Key engineer departure
    probability: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Cross-training, documentation, bus factor > 2
    contingency: Contractors on retainer

  - risk: Dependency delay (external team)
    probability: high
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Early engagement, shared milestones
    contingency: Alternative implementation, scope reduction

  - risk: Technology risk (new stack)
    probability: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Spike/Prototype in discovery phase
    contingency: Fall back to proven technology
```

## Roadmap Communication

### Audience-Specific Views

#### Executive View (1-pager)
```markdown
## Platform Roadmap — H2 2026

### Strategic Context
Our developer platform is growing 20% QoQ but reliability SLOs are at risk.
This roadmap focuses on: (1) platform stability, (2) developer adoption, (3) ecosystem growth.

### Key Investments (Ordered by Priority)
| Initiative | Investment | Impact | Timeline |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Multi-region deployment | 3 eng, 6 mo | 99.9% → 99.99% uptime | Q3 2026 |
| Developer self-service portal | 2 eng, 4 mo | 15 min → 3 min time-to-first-call | Q3 2026 |
| API marketplace | 4 eng, 6 mo | Partner ecosystem, new revenue stream | Q4 2026 |

### Trade-offs
- Developer portal v2 delayed to Q3 (SDK improvements prioritized)
- Mobile SDKs deferred to Q1 2027 (web SDKs cover 85% of use cases)

### How We'll Measure Success
- Platform uptime: 99.99% (currently 99.9%)
- Developer NPS: 55 (currently 32)
- Active platform partners: 200 (currently 50)
```

```markdown
## What We're Building Next for You

### Making Your Integration Faster
We're investing heavily in developer experience:
- New developer portal coming this summer
- Self-service API key management — no more email support
- Interactive documentation — try API calls in your browser

### Making Your API More Reliable
We're deploying across multiple regions so your integrations stay up:
- Active-active multi-region deployment
- 99.99% uptime SLA for Enterprise tier
- Real-time status dashboard

### Growing the Ecosystem
New partner marketplace (coming later this year):
- Discover integrations built by other companies
- One-click install for popular tools
- Revenue sharing for published integrations
```

### Roadmap Risk Communication
```yaml
risk_communication:
  format: "If → Then"
  examples:
    - "If we invest in multi-region, then we must delay the mobile SDK by one quarter."
    - "If the security audit reveals critical findings, then we will reprioritize Q3 scope."
    - "If the TypeScript SDK pilot shows strong adoption, then we will accelerate Python and Go SDKs."

  when_to_communicate:
    - After each quarterly planning cycle
    - When a dependency becomes blocked
    - When a key initiative is descoped
    - When new information changes priorities
```

## Roadmap Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----------|-----|
| Everything is P0 | No real prioritization | Lack of forced ranking | Use RICE/WSJF scoring, cap P0 items |
| Feature factory | Output-focused, no outcomes | No OKR linkage | Map every initiative to a KR |
| Gantt chart roadmap | Over-constrained dates | False certainty | Use horizon model (Now/Next/Later) |
| Watermelon status | All green on surface, red inside | No psychological safety | Blameless retrospectives |
| Perpetual "Now" | Nothing moves to Next/Later | Scope creep, no trade-offs | Freeze scope per quarter |
| Roadmap as a document | Stale before it's published | No living artifact | Monthly updates, quarterly reviews |
| Stakeholder surprise | Objections in review meeting | No pre-briefs | One-on-ones before group meeting |

## Advanced OKR Linkage Patterns

### Weighted KR Contribution Model
```python
def compute_kr_contribution(initiatives: list[dict]) -> dict:
    """Shows how each initiative contributes to each KR."""
    kr_contributions = {}
    for ini in initiatives:
        for kr_id in ini.get("kr_linkage", []):
            if kr_id not in kr_contributions:
                kr_contributions[kr_id] = []

### OKR Confidence Scoring
```yaml
okr_confidence:
  definition: "How likely are we to achieve this KR given current progress and remaining time?"

  scoring:
    1: "Wild guess — no data"
    2: "Plausible but uncertain"
    3: "On track — moderate confidence"
    4: "Strong progress — high confidence"
    5: "Already achieved or certain"

  usage:
    - Score each KR at the start of quarter
    - Re-score monthly — flag KRs dropping from 4→2
    - Reprioritize resources to KRs with dropping confidence
```

### OKR-to-Initiative Traceability Matrix
```yaml
traceability_matrix:
  objective: "Become the leading payment platform"
  KRs:
    - id: KR1
      name: "$50M API revenue"
      initiatives:
        - name: "Enterprise pricing tier"
          contribution: "40%"
          status: "in_progress"
        - name: "Partner marketplace"
          contribution: "30%"
          status: "planning"
        - name: "Usage-based billing"
          contribution: "30%"
          status: "planned"

    - id: KR2
      name: "1000 active partners"
      initiatives:
        - name: "Partner onboarding portal"
          contribution: "50%"
          status: "in_progress"
        - name: "Revenue sharing platform"
          contribution: "30%"
          status: "planning"
        - name: "Partner developer docs"
          contribution: "20%"
