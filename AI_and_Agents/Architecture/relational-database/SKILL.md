# Data Relational Database

## Purpose
Design relational database schemas with proper indexing, partitioning, replication, connection pooling, and query optimization strategies.

## Agent Protocol

### Trigger
Exact user phrases: "PostgreSQL", "MySQL", "relational database", "partitioning", "replication", "indexing", "vacuum", "connection pooling", "query optimization", "EXPLAIN", "CTE", "window function", "transaction isolation", "migration", "PgBouncer", "MVCC", "WAL", "B-tree", "GiST", "GIN", "BRIN".

### Input Context
Before activating, verify:
- Database platform (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite)
- Data volume (rows, growth rate, total size in GB/TB)
- Query workload (OLTP, OLAP, mixed)
- Current schema and migration tool (Alembic, Sqitch, Flyway, Liquibase)
- Existing indexing strategy and planner statistics
- Replication needs (read replicas, disaster recovery, logical replication)
- Connection pooling requirements (client count, max connections)

### Output Artifact
Database schema with indexes, partition configuration, replication setup, and query optimization plan as SQL and YAML.

### Response Format
```sql
-- Table DDL with partitioning
-- Index creation statements
-- Replication configuration
-- Migration statements
```
```yaml
# Connection pool config
# Replication setup
# Vacuum settings
```

No preamble. No postamble. No explanations. No filler/hedging/transitions. Compress output — why use many token when few do trick.

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] Normalized schema with appropriate constraints (PK, FK, CHECK, UNIQUE)
- [ ] Indexing strategy covering slow queries (EXPLAIN ANALYZE output reviewed)
- [ ] Partitioning scheme configured for large tables
- [ ] Replication setup (streaming for HA, logical for data distribution)
- [ ] Connection pool configured (PgBouncer transaction mode default)
- [ ] Vacuum and autovacuum settings tuned
- [ ] Transaction isolation levels chosen per workload
- [ ] Migration plan with rollback strategy

### Max Response Length
300 lines of SQL and configuration.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Schema Design
Normalize to 3NF by default. Denormalize only for read-heavy analytical queries. Every table needs a primary key (UUID or BIGSERIAL). Foreign keys with indexes on referencing columns. Naming: `snake_case` for tables, columns, indexes; `uq_` unique, `ix_` index, `fk_` foreign key, `pk_` primary key. Use CHECK constraints for domain integrity. Use ENUM or reference tables for constrained values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    status customer_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Step 2: Indexing Strategy
B-tree: default for equality and range queries on high-cardinality columns. GiST: full-text search, geometric data, range type overlap. GIN: JSONB, array containment, full-text search tsvector. BRIN: large sequential tables where rows are physically ordered (time-series). Partial indexes for filtered queries. Composite indexes with leading column matching the most selective filter. Covering indexes (INCLUDE columns) for index-only scans. Avoid over-indexing on write-heavy tables.

```sql
-- B-tree composite: equality then range
CREATE INDEX ix_orders_customer_created
    ON orders (customer_id, created_at DESC);

-- Partial: only active orders
CREATE INDEX ix_orders_active
    ON orders (created_at DESC)
    WHERE status = 'pending';

-- GIN: JSONB path operations
CREATE INDEX ix_products_attrs
    ON products USING GIN (attributes jsonb_path_ops);

-- BRIN: time-series with 100000 block range
CREATE INDEX ix_events_ts
    ON events USING BRIN (occurred_at)
    WITH (pages_per_range = 100000);
```

### Step 3: Partitioning
Range partition by date for time-series data. List partition by category/region. Hash partition for load balancing when no natural partition key. Sub-partitioning for multi-dimensional data. Each partition is a table — indexes must be created per partition or on parent (PG 12+). Partition pruning requires WHERE clause on partition key. Avoid too many partitions (>1000).

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id BIGSERIAL, occurred_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL, payload JSONB
) PARTITION BY RANGE (occurred_at);

CREATE TABLE events_2025_q1 PARTITION OF events
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-04-01');

CREATE TABLE events_2025_q2 PARTITION OF events
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-04-01') TO ('2025-07-01');
```

### Step 4: Replication
Streaming replication: primary ships WAL to standbys. Synchronous for zero data loss (2 safe). Asynchronous for performance (slight lag). Cascading replication for geographic distribution. Logical replication: publish/subscribe at table level, cross-version compatible, supports selective replication. Conflict resolution for bidirectional: last-write-wins or custom handler.

```yaml
# postgresql.conf streaming replication
wal_level: replica
max_wal_senders: 10
wal_keep_size: 1024  # MB
synchronous_standby_names: 'FIRST 2 (standby1, standby2)'
```

### Step 5: Connection Pooling
PgBouncer in transaction mode (default). Pool size = max_connections * 0.9 / pool_mode_transaction. Reserve pools for admin connections. Statement mode only for prepared-statement-free workloads. Session mode for session-scoped features (LISTEN/NOTIFY, temp tables). Configure timeouts to prevent idle consumption.

```yaml
# pgbouncer.ini
[databases]
* = host=localhost port=5432

[pgbouncer]
pool_mode: transaction
default_pool_size: 25
max_client_conn: 200
reserve_pool_size: 5
reserve_pool_timeout: 5.0
server_idle_timeout: 300
client_idle_timeout: 600
```

### Step 6: Query Optimization
EXPLAIN ANALYZE to find seq scans, nested loops, sorts. Identify: sequential scans on large tables, nested loop joins without indexes, excessive tuple deformations, temp file sorts. CTE optimization: PG 12+ inlines CTEs automatically when no side effects; use `MATERIALIZED` or `NOT MATERIALIZED` to control. Window functions: prefer ROWS frame over RANGE for performance; filter early with subqueries.

```sql
-- Check for sequential scans
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, TIMING) SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 'abc' AND created_at > '2025-01-01';

-- CTE with explicit materialization control
WITH filtered AS NOT MATERIALIZED (
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'shipped'
)
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) FROM filtered
WHERE total > 100
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### Step 7: Transaction Isolation
READ COMMITTED: default PostgreSQL, row-level lock only for concurrent writes. REPEATABLE READ: snapshot isolation, no dirty/non-repeatable reads, serialization failures on conflict. SERIALIZABLE: true serial execution, highest overhead, retry on 40001. Snapshot isolation in PostgreSQL prevents read-write conflicts that InnoDB allows. Use explicit locks (SELECT FOR UPDATE) sparingly and always with NOWAIT or SKIP LOCKED.

```sql
-- SKIP LOCKED for job queues
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM jobs
WHERE status = 'pending'
ORDER BY priority DESC
LIMIT 10
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED;
COMMIT;
```

### Step 8: Migration Management
Tools: Alembic (Python), Flyway (Java), Sqitch (language-agnostic), Liquibase (XML/YAML/JSON). Principles: every migration has forward and rollback script; migrations are idempotent; never modify existing migrations after merge; test migrations against a copy of production data. Zero-downtime migrations require additive schema changes (new columns nullable, backfill, then add NOT NULL). Avoid long-running locks by using `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` and `ALTER TABLE ... SET NOT NULL` with low lock timeouts.

```sql
-- Safe index creation without blocking writes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ix_orders_new
    ON orders (customer_id, created_at DESC);
```

### Step 9: Monitoring and Observability
pg_stat_statements for query performance tracking. pg_stat_activity for active connections and long-running queries. auto_explain for logging slow queries automatically. pg_stat_bgwriter for checkpoint and buffer management. pg_stat_replication for replication lag monitoring. Set up alerting for: replication lag > 10 seconds, long-running queries > 30 seconds, deadlocks, connection pool exhaustion, WAL generation rate spikes.

```sql
-- Long running queries
SELECT pid, now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration, query, state
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle' AND now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start > interval '30 seconds'
ORDER BY duration DESC;

-- Replication lag
SELECT application_name, state, sync_state,
       pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), replay_lsn) AS lag_bytes
FROM pg_stat_replication;
```

### Step 10: Backup and Point-in-Time Recovery
WAL archiving enables PITR to any point in time between the base backup and the last archived WAL. Configure `archive_mode = on` and `archive_command` to copy completed WAL segments to durable storage. Use `pg_basebackup` for physical base backups. Test recovery by restoring to a separate instance and running consistency checks. Retention policy varies: 7-30 days of PITR for most production systems, longer for compliance. Barman, pgBackRest, and WAL-G provide enterprise backup management.

```sql
-- Enable WAL archiving (postgresql.conf)
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'cp %p /backup/wal/%f'
archive_timeout = 60
```

### Step 11: Distributed SQL Databases
CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, and Google Spanner are distributed SQL databases providing horizontal scalability and global replication with ACID transactions.

```sql
-- CockroachDB: geo-partitioned table
CREATE TABLE user_data (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  region STRING NOT NULL, name STRING, data JSONB
) PARTITION BY LIST (region) (
  PARTITION us_east VALUES IN ('us-east-1'),
  PARTITION eu_west VALUES IN ('eu-west-1')
);
ALTER PARTITION us_east OF TABLE user_data
  CONFIGURE ZONE USING constraints = '[+region=us-east-1]';
```

### Step 12: Google Cloud Spanner
Spanner is a globally-distributed, strongly consistent relational database combining ACID with horizontal scalability using TrueTime for external consistency.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT64 NOT NULL, customer_id INT64 NOT NULL,
  total NUMERIC NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
) PRIMARY KEY (id, created_at);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
  order_id INT64 NOT NULL, item_id INT64 NOT NULL,
  product_id INT64 NOT NULL, quantity INT64 NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT FK_order_items FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders (id)
) PRIMARY KEY (order_id, item_id),
  INTERLEAVE IN PARENT orders ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

### Step 13: Vacuum and Autovacuum Tuning
PostgreSQL's MVCC creates dead tuples that vacuum removes. Autovacuum runs automatically but needs tuning for write-heavy tables. Key parameters: `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` (default 0.2, too high for large tables), `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`, `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit`. For large tables (> 10GB), set per-table autovacuum settings. Monitor `n_dead_tup` in `pg_stat_user_tables` — if it grows continuously, autovacuum is not keeping up.

```sql
-- Per-table autovacuum tuning for write-heavy table
ALTER TABLE orders SET (
  autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.01,
  autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 10000,
  autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = 2000
);

-- Check vacuum progress
SELECT relname, n_dead_tup, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE n_dead_tup > 10000
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
```

## Architecture / Decision Trees

### Index Type Selection

```
New Index
  ├── Equality + range on high-cardinality? → B-tree
  ├── JSONB/array/tsvector queries? → GIN
  ├── Geometric/full-text/range overlap? → GiST
  ├── Time-series, correlated physical order? → BRIN
  └── Spatial? → SP-GiST
```

### Replication Decision

```
Need replication?
  ├── HA, same version, all tables? → Streaming (async or sync)
  ├── Cross-version, subset of tables? → Logical
  ├── Distribution with conflict handling? → Logical (bidirectional)
  └── Reporting offload? → Streaming read replica
```

### High Availability Architecture

```
HA requirements:
  ├── RTO < 30s, RPO = 0 → Synchronous streaming replication + Patroni
  ├── RTO < 5min, RPO < 10s → Asynchronous streaming + Patroni
  ├── RTO < 15min, RPO < 1min → WAL archiving + recovery
  └── Multi-region DR → Logical replication across regions
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing foreign key indexes**: every FK column needs an index to prevent cascading seq scans on JOINs.
2. **Over-indexing write-heavy tables**: each index adds INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE overhead. Monitor write amplification.
3. **No autovacuum tuning**: default settings cause transaction ID wraparound and bloat on write-heavy tables.
4. **Connection leaks**: applications not returning connections to pool cause exhaustion.
5. **Too many partitions**: PG plans each partition. Over 1000 partitions degrades planning time.
6. **Sequential scan on large table**: missing index or wrong query filter causing full table scan.
7. **N+1 queries in application**: ORM generates N queries for N related entities instead of JOIN.
8. **No PITR testing**: backups exist but recovery is never tested. Test quarterly.
9. **Using VARCHAR(255) unnecessarily**: TEXT is same performance in PG, no need to restrict.
10. **NOT IN vs NOT EXISTS**: NOT IN can return wrong results with NULLs. Use NOT EXISTS.
11. **No connection pool for high-concurrency apps**: each connection consumes ~10MB. Pool limits connections.

## Best Practices

- Use `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, TIMING)` for all query performance investigations
- Set `random_page_cost = 1.1` for SSD storage (default 4.0 is for HDD)
- Monitor `pg_stat_user_tables` for seq_scan, n_tup_hot_upd (hot updates), n_dead_tup
- Prefer `BIGSERIAL` over `SERIAL` (no 32-bit overflow)
- Use `TIMESTAMPTZ` always, never `TIMESTAMP` without timezone
- Use `IDENTITY` columns over `SERIAL` in PG 10+ for better permission management
- Set `effective_cache_size` to 50-75% of total RAM for better query plans
- Schedule `VACUUM` during low-write windows for large tables
- Test `pg_restore` from backups quarterly
- Use `pg_stat_statements` to identify top resource-consuming queries
- Enable `auto_explain` for queries exceeding 5 seconds in development
- Use `SKIP LOCKED` for queue-style workloads
- Create indexes `CONCURRENTLY` to avoid blocking writes
- Monitor WAL generation rate for abnormal spikes indicating schema changes or massive writes

## Compared With

| Feature | PostgreSQL | MySQL | CockroachDB | Spanner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACID | Full | Varies by engine | Serializable | External consistency |
| Index types | B-tree, GiST, GIN, BRIN, SP-GiST, Hash | B-tree, Hash, Full-text, Spatial | B-tree, GIN, Inverted | Global secondary |
| Replication | Streaming, Logical | Async, Semisync, Group | Raft consensus | TrueTime + Paxos |
| Partitioning | Range, List, Hash (native) | Range, List, Hash, Key | Range, List, Hash | Interleaved |
| Extensions | Extensive (PostGIS, pgvector, etc.) | Limited | PG-compatible | SQL standard |
| Clustering | Patroni, repmgr, pg_auto_failover | InnoDB Cluster, Group Replication | Built-in | Built-in |
| Multi-region | Via logical replication | Via replication | Configurable | Automatic |

PostgreSQL vs MySQL: PG has better SQL compliance, more index types, richer extension ecosystem, and superior MVCC implementation. MySQL has better replication tooling (Group Replication, InnoDB Cluster), more managed cloud options, and simpler configuration for basic use cases. PG is通常 preferred for complex queries, data analytics, and applications needing advanced features (PostGIS, pgvector, full-text search).

Relational vs NoSQL: relational databases provide ACID transactions, strong consistency, and rich query capabilities. NoSQL databases provide horizontal scalability, flexible schemas, and specialized data models (document, key-value, wide-column). Use relational when data integrity and complex queries are paramount. Use NoSQL when scale, schema flexibility, or specialized access patterns matter more.

## Performance

- **Connection pooling overhead**: PgBouncer transaction mode adds ~0.5ms per transaction. Acceptable for most workloads.
- **Index maintenance cost**: each B-tree index adds ~10% write overhead. GIN indexes have higher maintenance cost.
- **BRIN vs B-tree on time-series**: BRIN is 100-1000x smaller than B-tree and faster for sequential scans on time-ordered data. B-tree for point lookups.
- **Partition pruning**: WHERE clause on partition key reduces planning time linearly with partition count.
- **CTE materialization**: PG 12+ inlines non-recursive CTEs automatically. Force materialization for CTEs used multiple times in the query.
- **WAL generation rate**: monitor `pg_stat_bgwriter` for checkpoint frequency. Too-frequent checkpoints = too much WAL.
- **shared_buffers**: set to 25% of RAM (typical). Beyond that, OS cache is equally effective.
- **work_mem**: per-operation sort/hash memory. Start at 4MB, increase for queries with large sorts or hash joins.
- **maintenance_work_mem**: for VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, ADD FOREIGN KEY. Set to 10% of RAM for faster maintenance operations.

## Tooling

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| pg_stat_statements | Query performance tracking |
| auto_explain | Automatic slow query logging |

- Set autovacuum thresholds per table based on write volume
- Use SKIP LOCKED for job queues to prevent deadlocks
- No DDL in transactions — use versioned migration tools
- Every migration must have a rollback script
- Monitor pg_stat_statements for outlier queries weekly
- Test PITR recovery quarterly
- Use CONCURRENTLY for index creation in production

**Decision criteria**: Evaluate throughput, consistency, geo-distribution, and operational team capacity.

## Implementation Patterns

### PostgreSQL Partitioning & Indexing
```sql
-- relational_database/orders_partitioning.sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id BIGSERIAL,
    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending'
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);

CREATE TABLE orders_2024_q1 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-04-01');
CREATE TABLE orders_2024_q2 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-04-01') TO ('2024-07-01');

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON orders (customer_id, order_date DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON orders (status) WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing');
```

### Connection Pooling Pattern
```python
# relational_database/connection_pool.py
from psycopg2 import pool
from contextlib import contextmanager

class DatabasePool:
    def __init__(self, dsn: str, min_conn: int = 4, max_conn: int = 20):
        self.pool = pool.ThreadedConnectionPool(min_conn, max_conn, dsn)

    @contextmanager
    def get_connection(self):
        conn = self.pool.getconn()
        try:
            yield conn
            conn.commit()
        except Exception:
            conn.rollback()
            raise
        finally:
            self.pool.putconn(conn)
```

## Production Considerations

- **Backup strategy**: Use pgBackRest or WAL-G for PostgreSQL; PITR with 7-day window; test restore monthly.
- **High availability**: Deploy Patroni/Stolon for auto-failover; 3-node cluster with synchronous replication.
- **Migration management**: Use Sqitch or Flyway for versioned schema migrations; zero-downtime via `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`.
- **Query monitoring**: Log slow queries (> 100ms) via `auto_explain`; monitor with pg_stat_statements.
- **Vacuum tuning**: Set auto-vacuum thresholds per table; monitor bloat with pgstattuple extension.
- **Resource limits**: Set PostgreSQL `max_connections = max_worker_processes * 2`; use PgBouncer for connection pooling.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| No connection pooling | Connection storm kills DB | Deploy PgBouncer / RDS Proxy |
| SELECT * in production apps | Unnecessary I/O, no index usage | Always specify columns |
| Missing foreign key indexes | Lock escalation on DELETE/UPDATE | Index all FK columns |
| Running VACUUM FULL regularly | Table bloat + downtime during reindex | Use `pg_repack` instead |
| Ignoring `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` | Persistent slow queries | Profile every query before deploy |

## Performance Optimization

- **Index strategy**: B-tree for equality/range; GiST for full-text/geospatial; BRIN for time-series on ordered data.
- **Partial indexes**: Use `WHERE` clause partial indexes for sparse query patterns (e.g., only active orders).
- **Covering indexes**: Use `INCLUDE` clause to create covering indexes for index-only scans.
- **Materialized views**: Refresh mviews for expensive aggregations (daily/hourly); concurrent refresh to avoid lock.
- **Partition pruning**: Ensure WHERE clauses align with partition keys for full partition elimination.

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Use `scram-sha-256` for PostgreSQL password auth; disable `trust` and `md5` in production.
- **SSL/TLS**: Enforce SSL for all client connections; set `ssl_min_protocol_version = 'TLSv1.3'`.
- **Row-level security**: Enable RLS on multi-tenant tables; policy based on `current_setting('app.tenant_id')`.
- **Audit logging**: Enable `pgaudit` extension; log all DDL and DML on sensitive tables.
- **Encryption at rest**: Use TDE or disk-level encryption (LUKS, EBS encryption) for database storage.
- **Secret rotation**: Rotate DB passwords every 90 days; use Vault for dynamic credentials (short-lived leases).

## Handoff
`data-etl-pipeline` for loading data into relational schemas
`data-data-warehouse` for dimensional modeling from relational sources
