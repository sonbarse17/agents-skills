# Hardware Acceleration: Extreme Quantization

## Mathematics of Sub-8-bit Quantization
Precision reduction targets $W$ (weights) and $A$ (activations) to compress memory footprint and accelerate compute-bound matrix multiplications.
- **GPTQ (Post-Training Quantization)**: Utilizes inverse Hessian approximation to iteratively quantize weights, minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of layer-wise outputs. Mathematically solves $\min_Q ||WX - QX||"_2^2$ via Cholesky decomposition.
- **AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization)**: Identifies a subset of salient weights based on activation magnitudes ($"|X|"$). Applies optimal scaling to protect salient weights, exploiting the Pareto principle where <1% of weights dominate output variance.

## Activation vs Weight Quantization
- **Weight-Only (e.g., INT4/INT8)**: Alleviates memory bandwidth bottlenecks in memory-bound autoregressive decoding.
- **Weight-Activation (W8A8)**: Accelerates compute-bound prefill phases by mapping GEMMs entirely into INT8 Tensor Cores.

## FP8 on NVIDIA Hopper Architecture
Hopper introduces FP8 (E4M3 and E5M2 formats).
- **E4M3**: 4 exponent bits, 3 mantissa bits. Optimal for forward pass (Weights/Activations) due to higher precision.
- **E5M2**: 5 exponent bits, 2 mantissa bits. Offers expanded dynamic range, crucial for gradient propagation in backward passes.
Transformer Engine seamlessly casts FP16/BF16 to FP8, leveraging hardware-native dot-products while mitigating overflow via delayed scaling.
