## Workflow

### Clean Room Architecture

A clean room is a controlled environment where multiple parties contribute data for collaborative analysis without exposing raw data to each other.

#### Core Components

1. **Join Key Service** — performs private set intersection to find common records without revealing non-matching records
2. **Query Engine** — executes queries within configurable constraints (aggregation only, min row count thresholds)
3. **Policy Engine** — enforces column-level access, output filters, and privacy budget
4. **Audit Logger** — records all queries, results, and policy decisions

### AWS Clean Rooms Example

### Private Set Intersection (PSI) Patterns

PSI allows two parties to find the intersection of their datasets without revealing non-intersecting records.

```python
# Python: PSI using hashed keys with salt
import hashlib
import os
import secrets

def hash_with_salt(identifier: str, salt: bytes) -> str:
    """SHA-256 hash with per-party salt for PSI."""
    return hashlib.sha256(salt + identifier.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

# Party A (Publisher): hash their user emails
party_a_salt = secrets.token_bytes(32)
party_a_users = [
    hash_with_salt("alice@example.com", party_a_salt),
    hash_with_salt("bob@example.com", party_a_salt),
]

# Party B (Advertiser): hash their user emails
party_b_salt = secrets.token_bytes(32)
party_b_users = [
    hash_with_salt("alice@example.com", party_b_salt),
    hash_with_salt("charlie@example.com", party_b_salt),
]

# Parties exchange hashed sets
# Intersection found by comparing hashes
# Only "alice@example.com" matches both sets
# Non-matching entries ("bob", "charlie") are never revealed
```

```yaml
# PSI protocol selection guide
psi:
  method: "ECDH-PSI"  # Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman PSI
  security_parameter: 128
  protocol:
    - "Each party generates an EC keypair"
    - "Parties hash their identifiers and blind them with their private key"
    - "Parties exchange blinded hashes"
    - "Each party applies their private key to the received set"
    - "Matching double-blinded values indicate intersection"
  advantages:
    - "No trusted third party required"
    - "Reveals only intersection cardinality or common rows"
    - "Linear complexity: O(n) communication"
  alternatives:
    - method: "DH-PSI"
      complexity: "O(n)"
      trust_model: "No TTP"
    - method: "Circuit-PSI"
      complexity: "O(n log n)"
      trust_model: "TTP optional"
    - method: "OPRF-PSI"
      complexity: "O(n)"
      trust_model: "Requires OPRF server"
```

### Differential Privacy Configuration

```sql
-- Configure differential privacy budget per party
ALTER CLEAN ROOM campaign_attribution
  SET DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY
    EPSILON = 1.0
    DELTA = 1e-6
    PER_PARTY_BUDGET = TRUE
    BUDGET_EXHAUSTION_POLICY = 'strict';

-- Per-query privacy loss tracking
CREATE TABLE clean_room_privacy_budget (
  party_account STRING,
  epsilon_allocated FLOAT,
  epsilon_consumed FLOAT,
  epsilon_remaining FLOAT,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP
);

-- Query-level privacy budget check
-- Before executing, check: epsilon_consumed + query_cost <= epsilon_allocated
```

| Scenario | Recommended Epsilon | Delta | Row Count Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ad attribution (two parties) | 1.0 | 1e-6 | 100 |
| Market research (three+ parties) | 2.0 | 1e-6 | 50 |
| Healthcare data collaboration | 0.5 | 1e-7 | 200 |
| Financial fraud analysis | 3.0 | 1e-5 | 25 |
| One-time research query | 4.0 | 1e-5 | 100 |

### Query Constraint Patterns

```json
{
  "query_policies": {
    "aggregation_requirements": {
      "min_group_size": 100,
      "min_group_size_for_percentiles": 1000,
      "max_query_rows_returned": 50000
    },
    "banned_patterns": [
      "SELECT\\s+\\*",
      "WHERE\\s+.*\\b(user_id|email|phone)\\b\\s*=",
      "GROUP\\s+BY\\s+.*\\b(user_id|email|phone)\\b",
      "ORDER\\s+BY\\s+.*(revenue|amount|value)",
      "LIMIT\\s+(1|[0-9]|[1-9])$"
    ],
    "allowed_functions": [
      "COUNT", "SUM", "AVG", "MIN", "MAX",
      "APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT", "DATE_TRUNC",
      "EXTRACT", "CASE"
    ],
    "banned_functions": [
      "PERCENTILE_CONT", "PERCENTILE_DISC",
      "NTILE", "ROW_NUMBER", "RANK",
      "DENSE_RANK", "LAG", "LEAD",
      "FIRST_VALUE", "LAST_VALUE"
    ],
    "output_filters": {
      "drop_singletons": true,
      "round_small_counts": true,
      "suppress_outliers": true,
      "rounding_method": "ceil_to_10"
    }
  }
}
```

### Audit Log Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE clean_room_audit_log (
  query_id UUID,
  requesting_party STRING,
  query_text STRING,
  query_hash STRING,
  executed_at TIMESTAMP,
  rows_input INT,
  rows_output INT,
  epsilon_consumed FLOAT,
  policy_violations ARRAY<STRING>,
  result_status STRING,  -- ALLOWED, BLOCKED, TRUNCATED
  submitted_by STRING,
  approved_by STRING
);

-- Monitor for policy abuse
SELECT
  requesting_party,
  COUNT(*) AS query_count,
  SUM(rows_output) AS total_rows_returned,
  SUM(epsilon_consumed) AS total_epsilon,
  MAX(executed_at) AS last_query_at
FROM clean_room_audit_log
WHERE result_status = 'ALLOWED'
  AND executed_at >= DATEADD('day', -30, CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY requesting_party;
```

## Rules
- Join keys must be hashed or use PSI; never share raw PII between parties
- All queries must use aggregate functions with minimum row count thresholds (>= 100)
- Ban `SELECT *` and row-level filtering on PII columns
- Track privacy budget (epsilon) per party; block queries that exceed the budget
- Log every query with input/output row counts and party identity
- Output must suppress small counts (rounding, ceil, or suppression of cells < threshold)
- Never allow raw data export from the clean room; results must be aggregated
- Set maximum output row limits (default 50,000 rows)
- Validate query patterns against banned operation list before execution
- Support revocation of data contribution; party can withdraw data at any time

## Architecture Decision Trees

```
Clean Room Architecture
├── Cloud provider ecosystem lock-in acceptable?
│   ├── Yes → AWS Clean Rooms / Azure Confidential Ledger
│   └── No → Open-source (Differential Privacy libs + TEE)
├── Real-time joins across parties?
│   ├── Yes → Secure multi-party computation (MPC)
│   └── No → Batch differential privacy (DP)
├── Regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR)?
│   ├── Yes → TEE-based (AWS Nitro, Intel SGX)
│   └── No → Cryptographic (HE, PSI)
└── Large-scale datasets (> 10 TB)?
    ├── Yes → Privacy-preserving aggregate queries
    └── No → Row-level PSI joins
```

**Decision criteria**: Evaluate trust model (honest-but-curious vs malicious adversary), scale, latency, and certification requirements.

## Implementation Patterns

### Differential Privacy Aggregation
```python
# data_clean_room/dp_aggregation.py
import numpy as np

class DPAggregator:
    def __init__(self, epsilon: float = 1.0, delta: float = 1e-5):
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.delta = delta
        self.sensitivity = None

    def compute_count(self, data: np.ndarray) -> int:
        self.sensitivity = 1
        noise_scale = self.sensitivity / self.epsilon
        noise = np.random.laplace(0, noise_scale)
        return max(0, int(len(data) + noise))

    def compute_sum(self, data: np.ndarray, bounds: tuple[float, float]) -> float:
        self.sensitivity = bounds[1] - bounds[0]
        noise_scale = self.sensitivity / self.epsilon
        clipped = np.clip(data, bounds[0], bounds[1])
        return float(np.sum(clipped) + np.random.laplace(0, noise_scale))
```

### Private Set Intersection Protocol
```python
# data_clean_room/psi.py
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes

class PSIProtocol:
    def __init__(self, key: bytes):
        self.key = key

    def hash_and_bloom(self, items: list[str], bloom_size: int = 1 << 20) -> bytearray:
        bloom = bytearray(bloom_size // 8)
        for item in items:
            h = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256())
            h.update(self.key + item.encode())
            digest = h.finalize()
            idx = int.from_bytes(digest[:4], "big") % bloom_size
            bloom[idx // 8] |= 1 << (idx % 8)
        return bloom
```

## Production Considerations

- **Noise calibration**: Set epsilon based on legal/compliance requirements; lower ε means more privacy.
- **Budget tracking**: Track DP budget consumption per data partner; reset quarterly or per campaign.
- **Query auditing**: Log all queries executed in the clean room with approval trail for compliance.
- **Output vetting**: Implement privacy loss threshold checks before releasing results (< 5% re-identification risk).
- **Key management**: Rotate PSI/encryption keys daily; store in HSM or cloud KMS.
- **Data retention**: Purge raw data from clean room after join completion; store only aggregated results.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Reusing the same epsilon across queries | Privacy budget exhaustion with no tracking | Per-query epsilon accounting |
| Joining on UID without PSI | Direct exposure of user identifiers | Always use PSI or salted hashes |
| No output vetting | Accidental PII leakage | Implement l-diversity / k-anonymity checks |
| Too-small epsilon | Useless noisy results | Calibrate ε based on dataset size |
| Ignoring delta parameter | No protection against catastrophic failure | Set δ < 1/N² for database size N |

## Performance Optimization

- **PSI optimization**: Use Cuckoo filters instead of Bloom filters for 30% faster intersection.
- **Batch processing**: Batch DP queries to amortize encryption overhead across multiple computations.
- **Parallel enclaves**: Distribute TEE processing across multiple enclave instances for large datasets.
- **Pre-filtering**: Filter non-intersecting records using pre-computed hash sets before DP computation.
- **Result caching**: Cache approved aggregate results for repeated queries (identical parameters).

## Security Considerations

- **Side-channel protection**: Use constant-time cryptographic operations in TEE to prevent timing attacks.
- **Enclave attestation**: Verify TEE attestation documents before loading data into enclave.
- **Input validation**: Sanitize all inputs to prevent SQL injection into clean room query engine.
- **Output constraints**: Limit returned rows to N (e.g., 1000) and suppress cell counts < threshold (e.g., 10).
- **Audit trail**: Immutable log of all queries, epsilon consumption, and approved results for auditor review.
- **Network isolation**: Deploy clean room in VPC with no internet access; data plane isolated from control plane.
