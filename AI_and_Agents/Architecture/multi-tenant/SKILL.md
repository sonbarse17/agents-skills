# Multi-Tenant Architecture Agent

## Purpose
Designs and enforces tenant isolation, lifecycle management, and cross-tenant operational patterns.

## Framework/Methodology

### TENANT-ISOLATE Framework
A six-phase approach to designing and operating multi-tenant systems:

Phase 1 - Tenant Model Definition: Determine isolation requirements based on compliance, security, and operational needs. Define tenant hierarchy (organization, workspace, user). Decide on data residency requirements.

Phase 2 - Environment Design: Select isolation model (DB per tenant, schema per tenant, row-level). Design tenant-aware infrastructure. Configure networking, encryption, and access control boundaries.

Phase 3 - Naming and Routing: Implement tenant ID propagation through every layer. Design tenant-aware DNS, API gateway routing, and database connection management.

Phase 4 - Automation: Build tenant provisioning pipeline with IaC. Implement lifecycle automation (provision, onboard, suspend, delete). Create tenant-specific monitoring and alerting.

Phase 5 - Operations: Design cross-tenant operations (analytics, backups, migrations) with isolation guarantees. Implement tenant-level rate limiting, caching, and resource quotas.

Phase 6 - Lifecycle Management: Define tenant state machine. Implement data export for portability. Handle suspension and deletion with compliance requirements. Plan for tenant migration across regions.

### Isolation Model Deep Dive

DB per tenant: Each tenant gets a dedicated database instance or cluster. Strongest isolation, best for regulated data (HIPAA, PCI), highest operational cost, complex to manage at scale (hundreds of DBs). Connection pooling and management overhead significant.

Schema per tenant: Shared database, separate schema per tenant. Moderate isolation, balanced cost. Schemas created programmatically during tenant provisioning. Cross-tenant queries use schema prefix. Best for mid-scale SaaS (50-500 tenants).

Row-level: Shared database and schema, tenant_id column on every table. Simplest operations, lowest cost, weakest isolation. Requires row-level security (RLS) policies or middleware enforcement. Best for B2C SaaS with thousands of tenants. Security risk if tenant_id is leaked or bypassed.

### Hybrid and Multi-Model Approaches

Hybrid: Use different isolation levels for different parts of the application. Example: customer financial data in per-tenant DB, configuration data in shared schema, logs in row-level table with indexed tenant_id.

Multi-model: Different customers get different isolation levels based on their compliance needs. Platinum customers get dedicated DB, standard customers get shared schema, basic customers get row-level. This adds complexity but optimizes cost.

### Tenant Hierarchy and Data Residency

Tenant Hierarchy Design Patterns:

Single-level: Tenant -> User. Simplest model. Tenant owns users and data directly. Best for B2B SaaS where each customer is a single organization. Tenant ID maps 1:1 to customer account.

Two-level: Organization -> Workspace/Project -> User. Common in collaboration tools (Slack, GitHub). An organization contains multiple workspaces, each with its own data boundary. Tenant ID at workspace level; organization-level operations (billing, global settings) cross workspace boundaries.

Three-level: Enterprise -> Division -> Team -> User. For large enterprise deployments with complex org structures. Data isolation at the team level, roll-up reporting at division/enterprise level.

Data Residency Requirements:

Regulatory data residency: Some regulations (GDPR, LGPD, China Cybersecurity Law) require data to stay within specific geographic boundaries. Map tenants to regions at provisioning time. Enforce at the storage layer (DB region, S3 bucket region). Block cross-region data movement for regulated tenants.

Opt-in data residency: Tenants can choose their data region during onboarding. Regional routing based on tenant configuration. Data migration between regions must be self-service and asynchronous.

### Tenant ID Propagation Architecture

Every request must carry tenant context through all layers:

1. API Gateway: Extract tenant ID from subdomain, header, or JWT claim. Validate tenant exists and is active. Reject requests for unknown/suspended tenants.

2. Service Mesh: Propagate tenant ID via HTTP headers or gRPC metadata. Service mesh middleware validates tenant context exists. If missing, reject or default to system context.

3. Application Code: Access tenant ID from request context. Use for data access filtering, feature flag evaluation, rate limit enforcement, and cache key scoping.

4. Database: Pass tenant ID via session variables or connection parameters (PostgreSQL SET, MySQL variable). Apply RLS policies or connection routing based on tenant ID.

5. Cache: Prefix cache keys with tenant ID. Use Redis key-space per tenant when isolation is critical.

6. Logging: Include tenant ID in all structured log entries. Enable per-tenant log correlation and filtering.

## Decision Trees

### Isolation Model Selection Decision Tree

1. Does the tenant data include regulated data (PHI, PII, PCI)?
   - YES -> DB per tenant (required for HIPAA, PCI DSS Level 1)
   - NO -> Go to 2

2. How many tenants do you expect?
   - < 50 tenants, enterprise -> DB per tenant (operational cost manageable, strongest isolation)
   - 50-500 tenants -> Schema per tenant (balanced cost and isolation)
   - 500+ tenants -> Go to 3

3. What is the average data volume per tenant?
   - > 100GB per tenant -> Schema per tenant (row-level becomes unmanageable at scale)
   - < 100GB per tenant -> Row-level with RLS (lowest cost, simplest operations)

4. Do you have mixed compliance requirements across tenants?
   - YES -> Hybrid model: DB per tenant for regulated tenants, row-level for others
   - NO -> Proceed with the model selected above

### Tenant Migration Decision Tree

1. Are you migrating between isolation models?
   - DB-per-tenant to row-level: Extract per-tenant DB -> transform to tenant_id columns -> bulk insert into shared DB -> validate parity -> switch routing
   - Row-level to DB-per-tenant: Extract tenant rows -> create per-tenant DB -> insert data -> validate -> dual-write during cutover
   - Schema-per-tenant to DB-per-tenant: Dump schema -> restore as separate DB -> update connection routing -> drop shared schema

2. Are you migrating tenants across regions?
   - Active-passive: Tenant writes to primary region, async replication to secondary. Cutover: promote secondary to primary within maintenance window.
   - Active-active: Both regions accept writes. Requires conflict resolution (CRDT, last-write-wins). Complex but zero-downtime migration.

3. Are you migrating between infrastructure providers?
   - Lift-and-shift: Full tenant data export from source, import to target. Requires extended downtime window. Simplest approach.
   - Parallel run: Run both old and new infrastructure. Dual-write critical data. Validate consistency before cutover. Most complex but safest.

### Tenant Onboarding Decision Tree

1. Is the tenant self-service or sales-assisted?
   - Self-service: Fully automated provisioning via API/UI. Tenant fills form -> instant provisioning -> welcome email. Target 1-2 minute setup.
   - Sales-assisted: Provisioning triggered by CRM (Salesforce webhook). Pre-configuration of pricing tier, region, and custom settings. Target 1-hour setup.

2. Does the tenant require custom configuration?
   - YES -> Provision base infrastructure first, then apply custom config via configuration service. Feature flags for tenant-specific behavior.
   - NO -> Use standard provisioning template. All settings come from tenant plan defaults.

3. Does the tenant need data migration from an existing system?
   - YES -> Provision target environment first, then run async data migration pipeline. Support incremental sync during migration window. Validate data parity before cutover.
   - NO -> Standard provisioning flow. No migration phase needed.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Isolation Model Selection
Evaluate three isolation models: DB per tenant (strongest isolation, highest cost, best for regulated data), schema per tenant (balanced isolation, shared DB, schema per tenant), row-level (simplest ops, shared everything, tenant_id column). Choose based on compliance requirements, tenant count, and operational complexity tolerance.

Decision matrix:
- Regulated data (HIPAA, PCI, GDPR high-risk): DB per tenant
- <50 tenants, enterprise customers: DB per tenant
- 50-500 tenants, mid-market: Schema per tenant
- 500+ tenants, B2C: Row-level with RLS
- Mixed compliance needs: Hybrid (DB per tenant for regulated, shared for rest)

The isolation model affects everything downstream: provisioning automation, backup strategy, cross-tenant analytics, cost allocation, and migration complexity. Choose carefully -- changing models later is expensive.

### Step 2: Tenant Lifecycle Automation
Implement tenant state machine: Prospect -> Provisioned -> Onboarded -> Active -> Suspended -> Deleted. Automate base infrastructure provisioning with IaC. Configure tenant-specific DNS, TLS, and monitoring. Onboard via API or admin UI. Support data export during suspension.

Tenant state machine:
- Prospect: Interest registered, no resources yet
- Provisioned: Infrastructure created (DB, buckets, queues), not configured
- Onboarded: Configuration completed, tenant admin user created, ready
- Active: Full operation, billing active
- Suspended: Non-payment or abuse. Data retained, access blocked. Grace period active.
- Deleted: Data purged after grace period. Irreversible.

Provisioning automation should be idempotent. If a step fails, retry from the last checkpoint. Use event-driven architecture (provision request -> message queue -> worker -> callback). Target provision time under 5 minutes.

### Step 3: Data Isolation Enforcement
Inject tenant ID middleware at the API gateway. Route database connections based on tenant isolation model. Encrypt data at rest per tenant when required. Apply row-level security policies for row-level model. Validate tenant boundaries on all data access.

Enforcement layers:
- API Gateway: Validate tenant ID in request, reject misrouted requests
- Application: Middleware extracts and injects tenant ID into downstream calls
- ORM/Data Layer: All queries include tenant_id filter (row-level) or use tenant-specific connection (DB/schema level)
- Database: Row-Level Security policies (PostgreSQL RLS, SQL Server Row-Level Security) as defense-in-depth
- Storage: Per-tenant encryption keys (KMS key per tenant) for maximum isolation

Testing data isolation: security tests should verify that Tenant A cannot access Tenant B data through any API, query, or export. Use penetration testing specifically targeting tenant boundary violations.

### Step 4: Tenant-Aware Infrastructure
Isolate cache keys with tenant namespace prefix. Apply rate limits per tenant. Configure resource quotas (API calls, storage, compute). Monitor tenant-level metrics. Implement tenant-specific feature flags.

Infrastructure isolation considerations:
- Cache: Redis key prefix per tenant, or separate Redis instance for large tenants. Cache eviction policies must not evict data across tenant boundaries.
- Queues: Tenant-tagged messages. Fair queue processing (one noisy tenant should not starve others).
- Rate Limiting: Per-tenant rate limits, separate from global limits. Burst allowance based on plan tier.
- Compute: Kubernetes with tenant-affinity scheduling for noisy-neighbor prevention. Resource quotas per namespace.
- Storage: Per-tenant buckets/folders with IAM policies. S3 bucket policy per tenant for direct access.

Tenant-level monitoring: track requests, errors, latency, and resource usage per tenant. Dashboard for customer-facing health. Tenant-level alerting on anomalies.

### Step 5: Cross-Tenant Operations
Design analytics pipeline that aggregates across tenants without exposing individual data. Implement batched migrations that iterate tenants. Build tenant-aware backup/restore. Handle tenant data export for GDPR right to portability.

Cross-tenant analytics: Use column-level access control or anonymization layer. Aggregate metrics at the platform level, never expose individual tenant data. Build a separate analytics data store (data warehouse) with appropriate access controls.

Backup and restore: Per-tenant backups for DB-per-tenant model. Tenant-tagged backup metadata for row-level. Ability to restore a single tenant without affecting others (point-in-time recovery at tenant granularity).

Data portability: Build exports as tenant-triggered async jobs. Format as JSON or CSV. Include all tenant-owned data. Compress and provide secure download link with expiration. Target export completion under 24 hours.

## Governance Framework

### Tenant Governance Board
Establish a cross-functional tenant governance board:
- Product: Defines tenant tiers and feature eligibility
- Security: Validates isolation controls and compliance
- Engineering: Reviews architecture decisions for tenant impact
- Finance: Approves cost allocation model for shared infrastructure

Meeting cadence: monthly for operational review, quarterly for strategic decisions.

### Tenant Architecture Review Process
1. New isolation model proposal submitted to architecture review
2. Impact assessment on existing tenants (migration required?)
3. Security review of isolation boundaries
4. Cost analysis for shared vs. dedicated infrastructure
5. Governance board approval before implementation
6. Post-implementation validation of isolation controls

### Compliance Mapping for Tenant Isolation
| Regulation | Isolation Requirement | Minimum Model |
|------------|----------------------|---------------|
| HIPAA | PHI separation, BAA required | DB per tenant |
| PCI DSS | Cardholder data environment isolation | DB per tenant |
| GDPR | Data portability, right to erasure | Row-level with export capability |
| SOC 2 | Logical access controls, data separation | Schema per tenant |
| FedRAMP | Moderate/High impact data separation | DB per tenant |
| CCPA | Consumer data access/deletion | Row-level with export capability |

## Common Pitfalls

Pitfall 1: Tenant ID not propagated to all layers. If tenant ID is available at the API layer but not in logs, database queries, or cache keys, isolation is incomplete. Trace tenant ID end-to-end.

Pitfall 2: Row-level security without defense in depth. RLS policies are powerful but a misconfiguration can expose all tenants. Never rely solely on RLS - enforce tenant filtering in the application layer too.

Pitfall 3: Noisy neighbor problem. One tenant consuming excessive resources affects all tenants on shared infrastructure. Implement per-tenant rate limits, resource quotas, and fair scheduling.

Pitfall 4: Shared schema migration challenges. A schema migration that works for row-level tenants affects all tenants simultaneously. Use online schema change tools (gh-ost, pt-online-schema-change) with tenant-by-tenant rollout.

Pitfall 5: Tenant data not fully deletable. GDPR requires complete erasure. If tenant data is scattered across logs, caches, backups, and analytics stores, deletion is complex. Design for deletability from day one.

Pitfall 6: Over-isolating adds unnecessary cost. DB per tenant for a B2C app with 10,000 tenants means managing 10,000 database instances. Match isolation to compliance and security requirements, not paranoia.

Pitfall 7: Cache pollution. Cache keys without tenant prefix can serve Tenant A data to Tenant B. Always prefix cache keys with tenant ID. Clear tenant cache on suspension/deletion.

Pitfall 8: Tenant provisioning not idempotent. If provisioning fails mid-way, retrying can create duplicate resources. Design every provisioning step to be idempotent. Use state tracking to resume from failure point.

Pitfall 9: Cross-tenant analytics leaking data. Aggregated queries can sometimes be reverse-engineered to infer individual tenant data (differential privacy attacks). Anonymize and aggregate sufficiently before exposing analytics results.

Pitfall 10: Ignoring tenant-level backup and restore. In shared models, a single restore affects all tenants. Build tenant-granular backup/restore capability. Test tenant-specific restore scenarios regularly.

## Best Practices

Practice 1: Treat tenant context as a security boundary. Every request must have validated tenant context. Every data access must filter by tenant. Treat tenant boundary violations as security incidents.

Practice 2: Automate tenant provisioning completely. Manual tenant setup does not scale and introduces errors. Provisioning should be API-callable and complete in under 5 minutes.

Practice 3: Implement tenant throttling. One abusive tenant should not degrade service for others. Use token bucket rate limiting per tenant. Hard limit on concurrent connections per tenant.

Practice 4: Test tenant isolation with security tooling. Automated security tests should regularly probe for tenant boundary violations. Include in CI/CD pipeline. Penetration test annually.

Practice 5: Design for smooth tenant migration. Tenants may need to move between regions, isolation models, or instance sizes. Build migration capability into the architecture. Test with real data.

Practice 6: Use structured tenant IDs. Tenant IDs should be immutable, URL-safe, and include a check digit for validation. UUID v5 from domain name is a good pattern.

Practice 7: Implement tenant-level circuit breakers. If one tenant's workload causes downstream service degradation, isolate that tenant's traffic from affecting others. Circuit breaker opens per-tenant, not globally.

Practice 8: Design tenant onboarding as self-service. Reduce time-to-value. Provide API endpoints and admin UI for tenant setup. Include guided setup wizard for complex configurations.

Practice 9: Plan for tenant data growth. A tenant that starts small may grow to need dedicated infrastructure. Build upgrade paths between isolation models. Make migration between models a first-class capability.

Practice 10: Maintain tenant-level audit logs. All access to tenant data must be logged with tenant ID. Enable tenant-specific audit trail for compliance reporting. Support log export per tenant.

## Templates & Tools

### Tenant Provisioning Automation Template
```
## Tenant Provisioning Workflow

1. API receives provision request with tenant details
2. Validate: no duplicate, plan tier in allowed values, region available
3. Create tenant record in tenant registry DB
4. Provision infrastructure (Terraform workspace per tenant or tagged resources):
   - If DB-per-tenant: create DB instance
   - If schema-per-tenant: create schema, run migrations
   - If row-level: ensure tenant_id in tables, run any per-tenant seed data
5. Create tenant admin user with initial credentials
6. Configure DNS: tenant-specific subdomain (tenant.example.com)
7. Generate TLS certificate (automatic with ACME/LetsEncrypt)
8. Initialize tenant configuration defaults
9. Create monitoring alerts for tenant
10. Send welcome notification with access instructions
11. Update tenant state to Provisioned

Estimated time: 3-5 minutes
```

### Tenant Deletion Runbook
```
## Tenant Deletion (30-Day Grace Period)

### Day of Suspend Request
1. Set tenant state to Suspended
2. Block all API access (gateway returns 403 with suspension message)
3. Notify tenant admin with suspension reason and grace period end date
4. Export tenant data (if requested)
5. Stop tenant-specific billing

### During Grace Period (30 days)
- Data retained but inaccessible
- Scheduled reminders at day 7, day 21, day 28
- Re-activation available via support

### After Grace Period (Day 31)
1. Set tenant state to Deleting
2. Delete tenant data in order:
   - Application data in primary DB
   - File storage objects
   - Cache entries
   - Queue messages
   - Log entries (or anonymize)
   - Backup snapshots
3. Remove DNS records
4. Release reserved resources
5. Archive tenant record in tenant registry (soft-deleted)
6. Send deletion confirmation to tenant
7. Set tenant state to Deleted
```

### Tenant Isolation Testing Checklist
```
## Tenant Isolation Test Cases

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: HIPAA-Compliant Multi-Tenant Healthcare Platform
A healthcare SaaS platform needed HIPAA compliance while serving 200 hospital customers. Each hospital required strict data isolation (PHI separation). The platform implemented DB-per-tenant for patient data (AES-256 encrypted at rest, per-tenant KMS keys) and shared schema for lookup data (states, ICD codes, drug databases). Tenant provisioning automated end-to-end with 5-minute setup time. Audit logging at tenant granularity. Passed HIPAA audit with zero findings on data isolation controls.

### Case Study 2: B2B SaaS Scaling from 50 to 5000 Tenants
A B2B SaaS company started with DB-per-tenant for their initial 50 enterprise customers. When expanding to SMB market (target: 5000 tenants), the operational cost of managing 5000 databases was unsustainable. They migrated to a hybrid model: row-level for SMB tenants (4800), DB-per-tenant for enterprise (200). Migration took 4 months. Cost per tenant dropped 70%. Operational complexity reduced to manageable levels.

### Case Study 3: Multi-Tenant Data Breach Near-Miss
A SaaS company with row-level tenant isolation discovered during a security audit that their GraphQL resolver was not filtering by tenant_id. A malicious tenant could potentially query other tenants data. The vulnerability was caught in audit before exploitation. Remediation: added tenant ID middleware at GraphQL layer, implemented RLS policies as defense-in-depth, and added automated tenant boundary tests to CI/CD. Incident response: treated as security incident, notified affected tenants, accelerated penetration testing schedule.

### Case Study 4: Global Data Residency Implementation
A SaaS platform expanding into EU and Asia faced data residency requirements (GDPR in EU, data localization in China). They implemented tenant-level region selection during provisioning. EU tenants stored data in Frankfurt, Asian tenants in Singapore, US tenants in Virginia. Data classified by sensitivity: regulated data (PII) stayed in region, anonymized analytics could cross regions. Cross-region data access logged and audited. Compliance validated with annual audits per region.

## Rules
- Tenant ID must flow through every request via middleware.
- Isolation model must match compliance requirements (HIPAA = DB per tenant).
- DB per tenant for regulated data; row-level for B2C SaaS under 10k tenants.
- Tenant deletion is soft-delete with 30-day grace period.
- Cross-tenant queries must never leak tenant boundaries.
- Tenant provisioning must be fully automated and idempotent.
- Cache keys always prefixed with tenant ID.
- Rate limits and resource quotas enforced per tenant.
- Tenant tenant context validated at every service boundary.
- Tenant state changes logged with audit trail.
- Tenant migration capability designed into architecture from day one.
- Backup and restore granular per tenant.
- Tenant data fully deletable (logs, caches, backups all covered).
- Noisy neighbor detection alerts configured for shared infrastructure.
- Tenant boundary testing included in security test suite.
- Tenant-level metrics monitored and alerting configured.
- Tenant onboarding supports self-service and sales-assisted flows.
- Data residency mapped to tenant provisioning region selection.
- Tenant architecture changes require governance board approval.
- All tenant isolation models support upgrade/migration paths.

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern: Row-Level Security with PostgreSQL RLS

```sql
-- Enable RLS on tenant-scoped tables
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE orders FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy that checks tenant_id against session variable
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON orders
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::UUID);

-- Application middleware sets tenant context
-- In Node.js/Express middleware:
--   await db.query("SELECT set_config('app.tenant_id', $1, true)", [tenantId]);
-- In Python/FastAPI middleware:
--   await db.execute("SELECT set_config('app.tenant_id', $1, true)", [tenant_id])
```

### Pattern: Tenant-Aware Cache Isolation

```typescript
class TenantCache {
  private redis: Redis;
  private readonly PREFIX = 'tenant';

  async get<T>(tenantId: string, key: string): Promise<T | null> {
    const data = await this.redis.get(`${this.PREFIX}:${tenantId}:${key}`);
    return data ? JSON.parse(data) : null;
  }

  async set<T>(tenantId: string, key: string, value: T, ttl = 300): Promise<void> {
    await this.redis.set(`${this.PREFIX}:${tenantId}:${key}`, JSON.stringify(value), 'EX', ttl);
  }

  async invalidateTenant(tenantId: string): Promise<void> {
    const keys = await this.redis.keys(`${this.PREFIX}:${tenantId}:*`);
    if (keys.length > 0) await this.redis.del(...keys);
  }

  async invalidatePattern(tenantId: string, pattern: string): Promise<void> {
    const keys = await this.redis.keys(`${this.PREFIX}:${tenantId}:${pattern}`);
    if (keys.length > 0) await this.redis.del(...keys);
  }
}
```

## Production Considerations

### Tenant Provisioning Automation
- Target: provision new tenant in < 3 minutes from API call to ready.
- Idempotent provisioning: each step retryable. State machine tracks completion. Resume on failure.
- Event-driven: tenant provision request → SQS/SQS queue → worker → callback webhook.
- Cost allocation: tag all resources with `tenant_id`. Track spend per tenant in billing system.

### Multi-Tenant Monitoring
- Per-tenant dashboards: request count, error rate, p95 latency, resource usage.
- Noisy neighbor detection: alert when single tenant consumes > 30% of shared resource.
- Tenant-level SLOs: uptime, latency, error rate per tenant. Alert on breach.
- Usage metering: record per-tenant API calls, storage, compute. Bill accordingly.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| RLS as only isolation layer | Misconfiguration exposes all tenant data. | Enforce at app layer + RLS as defense-in-depth. |
| No tenant ID in logs | Can't debug per-tenant issues. | Structured logging with tenant_id field. |
| Shared cache without tenant prefix | Tenant A data served to Tenant B. | Prefix all cache keys with tenant_id. |
| Single schema for regulated + non-regulated | HIPAA data in same table as free tier. | Hybrid model: dedicated DB for regulated. |
| Provisioning not idempotent | Retry creates duplicate resources. | Idempotent steps. Rollback on failure. |
| No per-tenant rate limiting | Noisy neighbor degrades all tenants. | Token bucket per tenant. Hard cap on connections. |

## Performance Optimization

- Connection pooling per DB: PgBouncer for DB-per-tenant models. Max 100 connections per tenant pool.
- Shard routing: partition tenants across DB instances. Consistent hashing on tenant_id.
- Cache isolation: Redis with `tenant_id` prefix. Per-tenant memory limit via `maxmemory-policy`.
- Read replicas: per-tenant read replicas for reporting workloads. Offload analytics.
- Index tenant_id columns: all shared tables indexed on tenant_id. Covering indexes for common queries.
- Batch tenant maintenance: scheduled jobs iterate tenants in batches of 100. Stagger to avoid load spikes.
- Materialized views per tenant for reporting. Refresh on schedule or event-driven.

## Security Considerations

- Tenant ID validation: every request checks tenant ID exists and is active. 403 for unknown/suspended.
- Authentication: tenant-scoped JWT. Token includes tenant_id, validated on every request.
- Authorization: middleware extracts tenant_id from token. Rejects multi-tenant queries without tenant context.
- Data encryption: per-tenant KMS keys for DB-per-tenant model. Shared key with tenant_id context for row-level.
- Audit logging: all data access logged with tenant_id. Tenant boundary violations treated as security incident.
- Network isolation: per-tenant VPC for dedicated DB instances. VPC peering for shared services.
- Backup isolation: per-tenant backup files. Encrypted with tenant-specific key. Cross-tenant restore blocked.
- Deletion: soft-delete with 30-day grace. Full purge with validation. Backup purge after deletion confirmed.
## Handoff
For compliance requirements on tenant isolation, hand off to `enterprise-compliance-audit`. For cost allocation per tenant, hand off to `enterprise-cost-governance`.
