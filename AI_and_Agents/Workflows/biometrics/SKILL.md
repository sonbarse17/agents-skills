# Mobile Biometrics

## Purpose
Guide for implementing biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint) with secure storage and fallback UX.

## Agent Protocol

### Trigger
Phrases: "biometrics", "Face ID", "Touch ID", "fingerprint", "fingerprint auth", "biometric auth", "face unlock", "local authentication", "biometric prompt", "device credential"

### Input Context
- Target platforms (iOS, Android, or cross-platform)
- Sensitivity level of protected operations
- Existing auth system (if any)
- UX requirements for lockout and fallback

### Output Artifact
Biometric auth module: availability check, prompt flow, secure storage with biometric protection, fallback to device credential, UX handling.

### Response Format
No preamble. No postamble. No explanations. No filler/hedging/transitions. Compress output — why use many token when few do trick.

### Completion Criteria
- Biometric prompt appears and resolves correctly
- Data encrypted with biometric key — inaccessible without auth
- Device credential fallback works when biometrics unavailable
- User can opt in/out of biometric auth
- 5-failure lockout enforced

### Max Response Length
6000 tokens

## Architecture / Decision Trees

### Biometric Use Case Decision Tree
```
What operation are you protecting?
├── App unlock (every launch) → Biometric + device credential
│   iOS: LAContext(.deviceOwnerAuthentication)
│   Android: BiometricPrompt with DEVICE_CREDENTIAL
├── High-sensitivity (payments, passwords, personal data)
│   → Class 3 (Strong) biometric required
│   Fallback to device credential
├── Low-sensitivity (dashboard view, quick action)
│   → Class 2 (Weak) biometric acceptable
│   No fallback needed — just require re-auth
└── Data decryption (read stored secrets)
    → Biometric key (Android: setUserAuthenticationRequired, iOS: biometryCurrentSet)
    Key invalidated on biometric enrollment change
```

### Biometric Class Selection
```
Which Android biometric class?
├── Class 3 (Strong) → BIOMETRIC_STRONG
│   Pin/pattern + hardware-backed biometric
│   Used for: payments, auth tokens, PII
├── Class 2 (Weak) → BIOMETRIC_WEAK
│   Face recognition, iris — less secure
│   Used for: convenience unlock, non-sensitive
└── Device credential → DEVICE_CREDENTIAL
    PIN, pattern, password — always available
```

## Workflow

1. **Biometric type detection** — Three categories of biometric authentication with varying security levels. Class 3 (Strong): Face ID (iPhone X+), Touch ID (iPhone 5s+), Pixel Imprint, ultrasonic fingerprint. Class 2 (Weak): face unlock on budget Android devices, iris scanner. Class 1: convenience face unlock. Android: Check with `BiometricManager.canAuthenticate(BIOMETRIC_STRONG)` vs `BIOMETRIC_WEAK`. iOS: `LAContext.canEvaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics)` — Face ID on devices with TrueDepth camera, Touch ID on devices with Touch ID sensor. Device credential (PIN, pattern, password) is always available as fallback and is considered a biometric alternative on iOS (`deviceOwnerAuthentication`), but not equivalent to biometric on Android (`DEVICE_CREDENTIAL` flag).

2. **Biometric availability check** — Before showing a biometric prompt, check: (a) Is biometric hardware available? (hardware present). (b) Is biometric enrolled? (user has registered at least one fingerprint/face). (c) Is device credential configured? (PIN/password set — required fallback). (d) Are there any transient issues? (security update required, sensor dirty, too many attempts — lockout). Handle each failure case with a specific user-facing message. On Android, `BiometricManager` returns distinct error codes. On iOS, `LAContext.canEvaluatePolicy` returns `NSError` with `LAError` codes. Never show biometric prompt without first checking availability.

3. **Authentication prompt flow** — Flow: user triggers protected action -> check availability -> if biometric available -> show biometric prompt with reason string -> user authenticates -> on success -> grant access -> on failure -> allow retry (up to 5 attempts) -> on 5th failure -> lockout -> force device credential. If biometric not available at start -> fall through to device credential. The reason string is mandatory on both platforms and displayed prominently. On iOS, `localizedReason` is shown in the Face ID dialog. On Android, `setTitle` and `setSubtitle` are shown in the system prompt. After successful authentication, the app receives a callback with (optionally) a `CryptoObject` for decryption.

4. **Secure storage with biometric protection** — Store sensitive data (auth tokens, encryption keys, passwords) in platform secure stores with biometric access control. Android: EncryptedSharedPreferences backed by Android Keystore — set `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)` on the master key to require biometric before reading. Or use Keystore `SecretKey` with `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)` and encrypt/decrypt data through `CryptoObject`. `setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment(true)` ensures key is destroyed if new biometric is enrolled (prevents stolen biometric from accessing old data). iOS: Keychain with `SecAccessControlCreateWithFlags` using `biometryCurrentSet` — item is only accessible after biometric authentication and is invalidated on biometric enrollment change. For "cache after auth" pattern, use `setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds` (Android) or `kSecUseAuthenticationUIFallback` (iOS).

5. **Fallback and UX design** — Always provide device credential (PIN/password) as fallback — never block users out. Three-tier fallback chain: Biometric -> Device Credential -> App Password (optional, for users who can't use either). UX patterns: opt-in onboarding screen explaining what biometrics protect, toggle in Settings to enable/disable, clear description of protected operations, graceful degradation on devices without biometric hardware. Lockout: after 5 consecutive biometric failures, biometric is blocked (iOS indefinitely until device credential used, Android for 30 seconds escalating). After lockout, show device credential prompt automatically. Never let users get stuck — always offer the next fallback option.

6. **Cross-platform implementation** — Using Capacitor Biometric plugin (`@capacitor/biometric`): single API for both platforms, handles availability check, prompt, and fallback. Using Expo LocalAuthentication: similar cross-platform API with `hasHardwareAsync()`, `isEnrolledAsync()`, `authenticateAsync()`. For React Native: `react-native-biometrics` or `react-native-keychain`. Cross-platform wrappers simplify code but may not expose all platform-specific features (CryptoObject, fine-grained error handling, key invalidation control). For sensitive apps, use platform-native implementation with cross-platform coordination.

## Biometric Strength Comparison

| Level | Android | iOS | Security |
|-------|---------|-----|----------|
| Strong (Class 3) | Fingerprint, Face (Class 3) | Face ID, Touch ID | High |
| Weak (Class 2) | Face unlock, Iris | Face ID with attention not required | Medium |
| Convenience (Class 1) | Basic face detection | None | Low |
| Device Credential | PIN, Pattern, Password | PIN, Password | Varies |

## Best Practices

- Never store raw biometric data — only authentication results
- Biometric data never leaves the device — no server-side biometric matching
- Device credential fallback is mandatory — no biometric-only gates for critical features
- User must explicitly opt in — no silent biometric enrollment
- Protect high-sensitivity operations: payments, password viewing, profile changes, security settings
- Cache biometric auth result for session duration (not per-action)

## Common Pitfalls

- **Lockout without recovery**: If no device credential fallback, user is permanently locked out. Always provide it.
- **Camera-based face unlock fails in low light**: Advise user or fallback to device credential.
- **Biometric changed alert ignored**: Apps that don't monitor `onAuthenticationError` with `ERROR_USER_CANCELED` after biometric change leave old data accessible.
- **Key invalidation surprise**: Keys invalidated on enrollment change delete encrypted data. Migrate before invalidation.
- **Missing usage description strings**: iOS rejects apps without `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` in Info.plist.
- **Calling biometric on main thread**: Android BiometricPrompt UI must be on main thread; heavy post-auth work goes to background thread.

## Security Considerations

- Biometric match probability: Face ID 1:1,000,000; Touch ID 1:50,000 — not cryptographic certainty
- Server-side auth must NOT rely solely on biometric claim — use biometric for local key release, then authenticate with key
- Anti-spoofing: Face ID with attention awareness is better than basic face unlock
- iOS `localizedReason` displayed in dialog — make it clear to user what's being authenticated
- Android `setConfirmationRequired(true)` adds button press to fingerprint — prevents accidental auth

## Configuration Reference

```kotlin
// Android — BiometricPrompt config
val promptInfo = BiometricPrompt.PromptInfo.Builder()
    .setTitle("Verify identity")
    .setSubtitle("Access your secure vault")
    .setAllowedAuthenticators(BIOMETRIC_STRONG or DEVICE_CREDENTIAL)
    .setConfirmationRequired(false)
    .build()
```

```swift
// iOS — LAContext
let context = LAContext()
context.localizedReason = "Unlock your premium features"
context.localizedFallbackTitle = "Enter Passcode"
context.touchIDAuthenticationAllowableReuseDuration = 10 // seconds cached
```

## Biometric Key Management & Crypto Integration

Biometric authentication is most valuable when used to protect cryptographic keys, not just as a boolean gate. The pattern: (1) generate a strong symmetric key (AES-256) in platform secure hardware, (2) bind the key to biometric authentication using `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)`, (3) use this key to encrypt/decrypt sensitive data (auth tokens, API keys, user credentials), (4) the key is only released when biometric authentication succeeds. Android Keystore provides this via `KeyGenParameterSpec` with `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)` and `setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment(true)`. iOS provides this via Keychain with `SecAccessControlCreateWithFlags` and `biometryCurrentSet`. For cross-platform, use platform-specific key storage and expose through a uniform `SecureEnclave` interface. Key invalidation on biometric enrollment change is critical security behavior — when user adds a new fingerprint/face, existing biometric keys are destroyed, requiring re-encryption of stored data. Apps must handle `KeyPermanentlyInvalidatedException` (Android) or `errSecItemNotFound` (iOS) gracefully by re-prompting for fresh credentials and re-encrypting.

## Multi-Factor Authentication Architecture

Biometrics alone should not grant access to high-value operations. For payments, password changes, or PII viewing, combine biometrics with another factor (MFA). Decision tree:
```
Operation sensitivity level?
├── Low (view dashboard, app unlock) → Biometric only
├── Medium (view profile, read messages) → Biometric + device credential
├── High (payments, password change, delete account)
│   ├── Option A: Biometric + OTP (TOTP or SMS)
│   └── Option B: Biometric + server-issued challenge
└── Critical (large transfers, admin actions)
    → Biometric + OTP + device credential (3-factor)
```

The MFA flow: (1) user authenticates with biometric on device, (2) app sends proof of biometric auth (key attestation or signature) to server, (3) server verifies the attestation and issues an OTP challenge, (4) user enters OTP from authenticator app, (5) server validates and grants access. For offline MFA, use time-based OTP generated from a seed stored in the biometric-protected keystore.

## Biometric Error Handling Decision Tree

```
Biometric authentication result?
├── Success → Grant access, cache auth for session
├── Failure (auth failed, fingerprint not recognized)
│   ├── Attempts < 5 → Show "Try again" with haptic feedback
│   └── Attempts >= 5 → Lockout biometric, force device credential
├── Error: biometric not enrolled → Redirect to Settings → enroll
├── Error: hardware unavailable → Fall through to device credential
├── Error: user canceled → Wait for next user action (don't immediately re-prompt)
├── Error: security update required → Show system update prompt
├── Error: sensor dirty/wet (Android specific) → "Clean sensor" message
└── Error: biometric changed (key invalidation) → Re-encrypt data with new biometric key
```

## Production Considerations

### Biometric Failure Modes

| Failure | Symptom | Mitigation |
|---------|---------|------------|
| No biometric enrolled | Feature disabled | Guide user to Settings to enroll |
| Key invalidation on biometric change | Decryption fails on existing data | Catch `KeyPermanentlyInvalidatedException`, re-encrypt |
| Lockout (5+ failures) | Biometric unavailable | Force device credential, never show biometric UI |
| iOS Face ID not configured | `canEvaluatePolicy` returns false | Info.plist missing `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` |
| Android sensor dirty | "Try again" repeatedly | Guide user to clean sensor |
| Biometric hardware absent | `BIOMETRIC_ERROR_HW_UNAVAILABLE` | Disable biometric section, fallback to PIN |

### Troubleshooting Checklist

- Verify `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` in Info.plist (iOS)
- Check `BiometricManager.canAuthenticate(BIOMETRIC_STRONG)` before showing prompt (Android)
- Confirm `setAllowedAuthenticators()` includes `DEVICE_CREDENTIAL` fallback
- Validate that biometric key uses `setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment(true)`
- Test lockout flow: authenticate 5 times with wrong finger — verify fallback to device credential
- Test biometric enrollment change: enroll biometric -> store data -> unenroll -> verify data inaccessible
- Test dual orientation: Face ID in portrait vs landscape
- Verify biometric caches correctly cleared on logout
- Ensure biometric toggle in Settings respected on app relaunch

### CI/CD Checklist

- Build includes correct Info.plist entries (iOS)
- AndroidManifest includes `USE_BIOMETRIC` permission
- ProGuard/R8 rules keep biometric SDK classes
- Lint against `LAContext` calls without `canEvaluatePolicy` guard
- Automated test: mock biometric success, failure, and lockout paths
- Accessibility test: biometric with VoiceOver/TalkBack enabled

### Session Caching Strategy Decision
```
How often should user re-authenticate?
├── Per-session (app launch → app background) → Cache on app foreground
│   Re-authenticate on return from background after timeout (5/15/60 min)
│   Valid only for the current app session — logout clears cache
├── Per-action (each sensitive operation) → No caching, require biometric each time
│   Use for: payments, password reveal, account deletion
│   UX: lightweight prompt (no full screen overlay)
├── Time-gated (re-auth every N minutes) → Biometric key with validity duration
│   Android: `setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds(300)` = 5 min cache
│   iOS: `LAContext.touchIDAuthenticationAllowableReuseDuration = 300`
│   Key remains accessible for duration without re-prompt
└── Device-unlock-gated → Use device credential (PIN) as proxy for biometric
    User has already unlocked phone → trust the device auth
    Low level of assurance — not for sensitive operations
```

### Biometric Enrollment Change Handling
```
Biometric enrollment changed (new finger/face added, or all removed)?
├── Key invalidated (setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment=true, biometryCurrentSet)
│   → Data becomes inaccessible: `KeyPermanentlyInvalidatedException` (Android)
│   → Must re-authenticate + re-encrypt all stored data
│   → Show clear message: "Your biometrics changed, please re-authenticate"
├── Key not invalidated (setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment=false)
│   → Old keys work even after new biometric enrolled
│   → Security risk: stolen biometric can decrypt old data
│   → Only use for: non-sensitive preferences, cached UI state
└── All biometrics removed from device
    → Keys remain if not invalidated by enrollment change
    → But no biometric available to unlock them — fallback to device credential
    → Recommend: delete biometric-protected data when no biometric enrolled
```

## Biometric Opt-In UX Patterns

Best practice: never force biometrics on users. Implement a progressive disclosure flow: (a) on first launch, skip biometrics, (b) when user accesses protected feature, show a one-time nudge suggesting biometric setup, (c) if declined, respect the decision for 30 days before another nudge, (d) provide a permanent toggle in Settings to enable/disable, (e) if user disables biometrics, fall back to device credential permanently. The Settings screen should show: enrolled biometric type (Face ID, Fingerprint), enrollment status (X fingerprints, Face enrolled), toggle for each protected feature, and a "Change biometric" button that triggers `showBiometric()` to re-enroll the key in Keystore. Never show biometric as the only auth option — always have a device credential path.

## Code Examples

### Android BiometricPrompt with CryptoObject
```kotlin
class SecureStorage(private val context: Context) {
    private val keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("AndroidKeyStore").apply { load(null) }
    private val keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(
        KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_AES, "AndroidKeyStore"
    )

    fun createBiometricKey(keyName: String) {
        val spec = KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder(keyName, KeyProperties.PURPOSE_ENCRYPT or KeyProperties.PURPOSE_DECRYPT)
            .setBlockModes(KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_GCM)
            .setEncryptionPaddings(KeyProperties.ENCRYPTION_PADDING_NONE)
            .setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)
            .setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds(10) // cache 10 seconds
            .setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment(true)
            .build()
        keyGenerator.init(spec)
        keyGenerator.generateKey()
    }

    fun encryptWithBiometric(keyName: String, data: String, onSuccess: (ByteArray) -> Unit, onError: (String) -> Unit) {
        val secretKey = keyStore.getKey(keyName, null) as SecretKey
        val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding")
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey)

        val biometricPrompt = BiometricPrompt(
            activity,
            ContextCompat.getMainExecutor(context),
            object : BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback() {
                override fun onAuthenticationSucceeded(result: BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationResult) {
                    val encrypted = cipher.doFinal(data.toByteArray())
                    onSuccess(encrypted)
                }
                override fun onAuthenticationError(errorCode: Int, errString: CharSequence) {
                    onError(errString.toString())
                }
            }
        )

        val promptInfo = BiometricPrompt.PromptInfo.Builder()
            .setTitle("Authenticate to access secure data")
            .setSubtitle("Biometric required for decryption")
            .setAllowedAuthenticators(BIOMETRIC_STRONG or DEVICE_CREDENTIAL)
            .build()

        biometricPrompt.authenticate(promptInfo, BiometricPrompt.CryptoObject(cipher))
    }
}
```

### iOS Keychain with Biometric Protection
```swift
import LocalAuthentication
import Security

class BiometricKeychain {
    enum KeychainError: Error {
        case itemNotFound, duplicateItem, unexpectedStatus(OSStatus)
    }

    func storeWithBiometric(service: String, account: String, data: Data) throws {
        let accessControl = SecAccessControlCreateWithFlags(
            nil,
            kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly,
            [.biometryCurrentSet],
            nil
        )!
        let query: [String: Any] = [
            kSecClass as String: kSecClassGenericPassword,
            kSecAttrService as String: service,
            kSecAttrAccount as String: account,
            kSecValueData as String: data,
            kSecAttrAccessControl as String: accessControl,
            kSecUseAuthenticationContext as String: LAContext()
        ]
        let status = SecItemAdd(query as CFDictionary, nil)
        guard status == errSecSuccess else {
            throw KeychainError.unexpectedStatus(status)
        }
    }

    func readWithBiometric(service: String, account: String) throws -> Data {
        let context = LAContext()
        context.localizedReason = "Authenticate to access your stored credentials"

        let query: [String: Any] = [
            kSecClass as String: kSecClassGenericPassword,
            kSecAttrService as String: service,
            kSecAttrAccount as String: account,
            kSecReturnData as String: true,
            kSecUseAuthenticationContext as String: context,
            kSecMatchLimit as String: kSecMatchLimitOne
        ]
        var result: AnyObject?
        let status = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &result)
        guard status == errSecSuccess else {
            throw KeychainError.unexpectedStatus(status)
        }
        return result as! Data
    }

    func delete(service: String, account: String) throws {
        let query: [String: Any] = [
            kSecClass as String: kSecClassGenericPassword,
            kSecAttrService as String: service,
            kSecAttrAccount as String: account
        ]
        let status = SecItemDelete(query as CFDictionary)
        guard status == errSecSuccess else {
            throw KeychainError.unexpectedStatus(status)
        }
    }
}
```

### Cross-Platform (React Native)
```typescript
import ReactNativeBiometrics from 'react-native-biometrics';

const rnBiometrics = new ReactNativeBiometrics();

export async function checkBiometricAvailability() {
  const { available, biometryType } = await rnBiometrics.isSensorAvailable();
  return { available, type: biometryType };
  // biometryType: Biometrics.FaceID | Biometrics.TouchID | Biometrics.Biometrics
}

export async function authenticateWithBiometric(reason: string) {
  const { success } = await rnBiometrics.simplePrompt({ promptMessage: reason });
  return success;
}

export async function createBiometricKey() {
  const { publicKey } = await rnBiometrics.createKeys();
  return publicKey;  // send to server for challenge-response auth
}

export async function signWithBiometric(payload: string) {
  const { success, signature } = await rnBiometrics.createSignature({
    promptMessage: 'Sign in with biometrics',
    payload,
  });
  return { success, signature };
}
```

### Biometric Implementation Anti-Patterns

- **Timeout on biometric key too long**: `setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds(86400)` = 24 hours. A compromised device exposes data for a full day. Max recommended: 300 seconds (5 min).
- **No biometric enrollment change watcher**: Biometric enrollment changes (user adds/removes fingerprint or face) invalidate keys silently. Subscribe to `ACTION_BIOMETRIC_ENROLLMENT_CHANGED` (Android) or check `biometryCurrentSet` on each app launch.
- **Fallback to app password without device credential**: Users can type an app-specific password instead of device PIN. This creates a secondary auth channel that is often less secure. Always prefer device credential over app password.
- **Biometric-only settings toggle**: "Enable Face ID" toggle without showing what features it affects. Users enable it thinking all security is handled, but payments still need device credential. Show a per-feature matrix.
- **Not handling `ERROR_VENDOR` (Android)**: Vendor-specific errors (OEM-specific biometric implementations) can crash the app. Never assume only standard error codes. Wrap in try/catch.
- **Face authentication without attention check**: On iOS, `LAContext.notRequireAttention` allows face unlock with closed eyes. For high-sensitivity operations, require attention by relying on the default (attention required).
- **Re-prompting after user cancel**: User cancels biometric prompt, app immediately re-shows it — frustrating. After user cancel, wait for explicit user action before re-prompting.
- **Caching biometric success for entire app session**: Cache should expire. A user may unlock the app at 9am, hand their phone to someone at 10am — cached biometric access still grants permission. Set session timeout (5-15 min).

### Biometric Performance & Battery Considerations

| Operation | Typical Duration | Battery Impact |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Face ID recognition | ~150ms | Minimal (Neural Engine) |
| Touch ID recognition | ~200ms | Minimal |
| Biometric key decryption | ~50ms | Negligible |
| Biometric prompt UI show | ~100ms | Negligible |
| Key generation (first time) | ~200-500ms | Small (one-time) |
| Key invalidation on enrollment change | ~10ms | Negligible |

Biometric operations are hardware-accelerated on modern devices (Secure Enclave / Titan M). They do not require network access. Battery impact is minimal — comparable to pressing a button. The only power concern is the camera-based Face ID on older iPhones (iPhone X/XR) which uses the TrueDepth camera briefly per authentication.

### Biometric Regulatory & Compliance Considerations

GDPR considers biometric data "special category" data requiring explicit consent. Key requirements: (a) biometric data must be processed on-device — never send raw biometric templates to servers, (b) user must explicitly opt-in to biometric auth with clear disclosure of what data is stored, (c) user must be able to revoke biometric consent at any time, (d) on revocation, all biometric-protected keys must be deleted, (e) biometric data must be encrypted at rest (which it is by default in Secure Enclave/Keystore), (f) data retention: biometric templates should not be stored long-term — use device-native biometric APIs that manage templates in the secure processor, (g) transparency: the privacy policy must disclose biometric usage, data storage location, and retention period.

### Biometric Testing Matrix

| Test Scenario | Expected Behavior | Platform Differences |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Enrolled biometric → success | Grant access | Both platforms |
| Wrong finger/face → failure | Show retry, count attempts | Both platforms |
| 5 failures → lockout | Force device credential | iOS: locks until device credential used. Android: 30s timeout |
| No biometric enrolled | Fallback to device credential | Check `canAuthenticate` first |
| Biometric enrollment change | Key invalidated, data inaccessible | Must re-encrypt data |
| Device credential entered | Grant access as fallback | Both |
| System biometric settings changed during app use | Check status on app return from background | Both |
| User cancels prompt | Wait for explicit next action | Both |
| Call interruption during auth | Resume or retry auth | Handle `onAuthenticationError` with `ERROR_CANCELED` |
| Accessibility: VoiceOver/TalkBack active | Biometric prompt must be accessible | Test with screen reader enabled |

### Code Examples — Biometric Session Cache

```swift
class BiometricSessionCache {
    private var lastAuthTimestamp: Date?
    private let sessionTimeout: TimeInterval = 300 // 5 minutes

    var isSessionValid: Bool {
        guard let lastAuth = lastAuthTimestamp else { return false }
        return Date().timeIntervalSince(lastAuth) < sessionTimeout
    }

    func authenticate(reason: String, completion: @escaping (Bool) -> Void) {
        if isSessionValid {
            completion(true) // Use cached auth
            return
        }
        let context = LAContext()
        context.localizedReason = reason
        context.evaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics,
                              localizedReason: reason) { success, error in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                if success {
                    self.lastAuthTimestamp = Date()
                }
                completion(success)
            }
        }
    }

    func invalidateSession() {
        lastAuthTimestamp = nil // Called on logout or security event
    }
}
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Observer Pattern for Event Handling
`
interface EventObserver<T> {

class EventBus<T> {
  private observers: Set<EventObserver<T>> = new Set();

### Configuration-Driven Approach
`
config:
  defaults:
    timeout: 30s
    retryCount: 3
  overrides:
    production:
      timeout: 60s
      retryCount: 5
    development:
      timeout: 300s
      retryCount: 1
`

## Production Considerations

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Configuration validated against schema before startup
- [ ] Health check endpoints registered and monitored
- [ ] Graceful shutdown with draining period (30s timeout)
- [ ] Resource limits configured (CPU, memory, file descriptors)
- [ ] Log level set appropriate for environment
- [ ] Metrics endpoint secured and exposed
- [ ] Rate limiting configured per-tier
- [ ] TLS certificates valid and auto-renewing
- [ ] Database migrations run as separate deployment step
- [ ] Feature flags ready for gradual rollout

### Monitoring and Alerting
| Metric | Threshold | Severity | Action |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Error rate | > 1% over 5min | Critical | Page on-call |
| p99 latency | > 2s over 5min | Warning | Investigate |
| Throughput drop | > 50% over 1min | Critical | Check upstream |
| Queue depth | > 1000 over 1min | Warning | Scale consumers |
| Disk usage | > 85% | Warning | Clean or expand |
| Memory usage | > 90% heap | Critical | Restart or scale |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Solution |
|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Premature optimization | Complex code for no measured benefit | Guessing instead of profiling | Measure first, optimize based on data |
| Copy-paste reuse | Duplicate code across codebase | Lack of abstraction | Extract shared logic into libraries |
| Gold-plating | Features with no current requirement | Over-engineering | YAGNI — build what's needed now |
| Magical thinking | Assumptions without validation | Skipping error handling | Handle all failure modes explicitly |

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
Cache hierarchy: L1 (in-memory local) → L2 (distributed Redis/Memcached) → L3 (CDN/Edge).
Cache invalidation: TTL-based (simple, stale), event-based (complex, fresh), write-through (consistent, higher write latency), write-behind (fast writes, eventual consistency).

### Resource Pooling
- Database connections: Pool of reusable connections (HikariCP, pgBouncer)
- HTTP connections: Keep-alive + connection pooling for external calls
- Thread pool: Bounded thread pools for async task execution

### Profiling Methodology
1. Establish baseline with production traffic profile
2. Profile CPU with sampling profiler (pprof, perf, async-profiler)
3. Profile memory with heap dumps and allocation tracking
4. Profile I/O with strace/perf trace for syscall analysis
5. Profile latency with distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
6. Identify bottleneck, formulate hypothesis, implement fix
7. Re-profile to verify improvement, repeat

## Security Considerations

### Threat Modeling (STRIDE)
- Spoofing: Identity validation, authentication
- Tampering: Integrity checks, digital signatures
- Repudiation: Audit logs, non-repudiation
- Information disclosure: Encryption, access control
- Denial of service: Rate limiting, resource quotas
- Elevation of privilege: Principle of least privilege

### Supply Chain Security
- Dependency scanning: Snyk, Dependabot, Trivy
- SBOM generation: CycloneDX or SPDX format
- Signed commits: GPG or SSH commit signing
- Artifact verification: Checksum validation, signature verification

### Secrets Management
- Secrets never in code — always in secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Rotation policy: Rotate database credentials every 90 days
- Access audit: Log every secrets access, alert on anomalies
- Encryption at rest and in transit for all secrets
- Principle of least privilege: each service gets only its own secrets

## Rules
- Default-deny security posture — allow only explicitly required access.
- All inputs validated, all outputs encoded, all errors handled.
- Defend in depth — multiple layers of security controls.
- Fail securely — errors default to safe behavior.
- Log security-relevant events for audit and investigation.
- Keep dependencies updated — automate vulnerability scanning.
- Design for observability from day one, not as an afterthought.
- Document all architectural decisions with rationale.
- Review code for security, performance, and correctness before merging.
