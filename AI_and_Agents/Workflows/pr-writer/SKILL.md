# PR Writer

## Purpose
Write effective pull request descriptions — clear, structured, and reviewable — that communicate what changed, why it changed, and how it was validated. Good PR descriptions reduce review time, catch bugs earlier, and create an auditable project history.

## Agent Protocol

### Trigger
Exact user phrases: "write PR", "pull request", "PR description", "PR template", "create PR", "open a PR", "draft PR", "PR summary", "PR title", "write a pull request".

### Input Context
- PR type (feature, bugfix, refactor, chore, docs, hotfix)
- Code changes (files changed, additions/deletions, key modifications)
- Issue or ticket reference (GitHub issue, JIRA, Linear)
- Testing done (unit, integration, manual, E2E)
- Dependencies or breaking changes
- Reviewer notes (areas of concern, decisions made)

### Output Artifact
Pull request with title following convention, structured description, and review guidance.

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] PR title follows Conventional Commits format
- [ ] Description includes what, why, and how
- [ ] Related issues linked
- [ ] Screenshots or screen recordings included (UI changes)
- [ ] Testing methodology described
- [ ] Breaking changes highlighted
- [ ] Deployment considerations noted
- [ ] Reviewers added with specific focus areas
- [ ] CI status checked and passing

### Max Response Length
150 lines.

## Framework/Methodology

### PR Size Decision Tree
```
How large is the change?
├── Small (< 100 lines, single concern)
│   → Direct review, one reviewer
│   → Merge after single approval
├── Medium (100-500 lines, 1-3 files)
│   → Standard review, 1-2 reviewers
│   → Focus on logic and edge cases
├── Large (500-2000 lines, multiple files)
│   → Consider splitting into smaller PRs
│   → Request specific reviewers for specific areas
└── Huge (> 2000 lines)
    → MUST split into multiple PRs
    → Each PR must be independently reviewable
```

### PR Title Conventions
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Examples:
feat(api): add user avatar upload endpoint
fix(auth): handle expired token refresh race condition
refactor(state): extract state management into dedicated module
docs(readme): update API documentation links
chore(deps): upgrade TypeScript to v5.4
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Set Up PR Template

```markdown
<!-- .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md -->
## Description
<!-- Briefly describe what this PR does and why -->

Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER

## Type of Change
- [ ] 🚀 New feature
- [ ] 🐛 Bug fix
- [ ] ♻️ Refactoring (no functional changes)
- [ ] 📚 Documentation
- [ ] 🔧 Chore (deps, build, CI)
- [ ] ⚡ Performance improvement

- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests added/updated
- [ ] Manual testing (describe scenarios)
- [ ] Tested in production/staging environment

## Screenshots (if applicable)
<!-- Before/after for UI changes -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Explain WHY you made specific choices -->

## Breaking Changes
<!-- List any breaking changes and migration steps -->

## Deployment Notes
<!-- Database migrations, env vars, feature flags, rollback plan -->

## Reviewer Focus Areas
<!-- What specific parts should the reviewer pay attention to? -->

## Checklist
- [ ] My code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] No new warnings introduced
- [ ] Tests pass locally
```

### Step 2: Write the PR Body

```markdown
## Description
Adds user avatar upload functionality. Users can now upload a profile
photo from their settings page. Images are resized to 256x256, stored
in S3, and served via CDN.

Fixes #142

## Type of Change
- [x] 🚀 New feature

## How Has This Been Tested?
- [x] Unit tests for AvatarService (image validation, resize, upload)
- [x] Integration test for S3 upload mock
- [x] Manual: uploaded images in various formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, WEBP)
- [x] Manual: tested with files >5MB (correctly rejected)
- [x] Manual: verified avatar displays in header, settings, profile pages

## Screenshots
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ![before](https://i.imgur.com/old.png) | ![after](https://i.imgur.com/new.png) |

## Key Decisions
- **ImageMagick for resizing**: Sharp was faster but has native dependency
  issues in our CI. ImageMagick via shell is more portable.
- **256x256 max size**: Based on UI analysis — avatar displays at max 48px
  in most places. 256px provides retina-ready quality.
- **CDN cache TTL: 7 days**: Avatars rarely change, long cache improves
  load times. Etag-based invalidation for immediate updates.

## Breaking Changes
None. This is additive only.

## Deployment Notes
- Requires: `AVATAR_S3_BUCKET` and `CDN_URL` env vars (added to Terraform)
- New migration: `add_avatar_url_to_users` (automated, zero-downtime)
- S3 bucket and CDN distribution via Terraform PR #138

## Reviewer Focus Areas
- @alice: Image validation logic in `src/services/avatar.ts` (security)
- @bob: S3 integration and error handling (reliability)

## Checklist
- [x] Code follows style guidelines
- [x] Self-review completed
- [x] Documentation updated (README API section)
- [x] No new warnings
- [x] All tests passing
```

### Step 3: PR Description Generator Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/generate-pr-body.sh
# Generate PR body from conventional commit + git diff summary

COMMIT_MSG=$(git log --format="%s" HEAD~1..HEAD)
COMMIT_BODY=$(git log --format="%b" HEAD~1..HEAD | sed '/^$/d')
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff HEAD~1..HEAD --stat -- ':!package-lock.json')
DIFF_STATS=$(echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | tail -1)

cat << PRBODY
## Description

$COMMIT_BODY

## Changes

$CHANGED_FILES

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Tests pass locally

PRBODY
```

### Step 4: PR Best Practices

```yaml
pr_writing_rules:
  - "PR title must follow Conventional Commits format"
  - "PR must reference at least one issue (or explain why not)"
  - "PR description must explain WHY, not WHAT (code shows WHAT)"
  - "UI changes must include screenshots or recordings"
  - "Breaking changes must be clearly marked with migration steps"
  - "Keep PRs under 400 lines for reviewability"
  - "Multiple PRs for features spanning more than 3 days of work"
  - "Draft PRs for incomplete work (WIP prefix or Draft mode)"
  - "Self-review before requesting external review"

pr_do_dont:
  - DO: "Explain the problem being solved"
  - DO: "Link to related issues, discussions, or decisions"
  - DO: "Call out areas needing special attention"
  - DO: "Include test evidence (coverage, manual scenarios)"
  - DONT: "Write 'See commits for details'"
  - DONT: "Leave PR body empty"
  - DONT: "Include unrelated changes"
  - DONT: "Skip screenshots for UI changes"

reviewer_etiquette:
  - "Request specific reviewer with context why"
  - "Respect reviewer time: make PRs easy to review"
  - "Respond to comments within 24 hours"
  - "Thank reviewers for thorough feedback"
  - "Don't merge without all comments resolved"
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Description | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Empty or minimal description | Reviewer has no context | Always fill in what/why/how |
| GIANT PR (2000+ lines) | Impossible to review properly | Split into logical, reviewable chunks |
| No screenshots for UI | Reviewer must run code to see changes | Always include before/after screenshots |
| Forgetting issue links | PR has no context reference | Template enforces issue link |
| Vague testing description | "Tested locally" without details | List specific test scenarios |
| Mixed concerns | Bug fix + refactor + feature in one PR | One concern per PR |
| No decision rationale | Questions like "why this approach?" unanswered | Document key decisions |
| Missing migration steps | DB changes applied without coordination | Always note deployment steps |

## Best Practices

| Practice | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Fill out the template | Consistent structure speeds review |
| Keep PR under 400 lines | Research shows review effectiveness drops sharply after 400 lines |
| One PR = one concern | Easier to review, revert, and understand |
| Screenshots for UI | Visual context that code cannot convey |
| Link issues | Traceability from code to requirement |
| Call out risky changes | Focus reviewer attention where it matters |
| Self-review before submitting | Catches 50%+ of issues before review |
| Respond to feedback with changes, not excuses | Address the concern in code |
| Use Draft PR for early feedback | Get architecture review before implementation detail |
| Write PR description BEFORE the last commit | Describes intent, not just summary |

## Architecture Decision Trees

### PR Merge Strategy

```
What's the PR size and context?
├── Single commit / clean history
│   └── Rebase merge → Preserves individual commits
│
├── Multiple commits, single concern
│   └── Squash merge → Clean single commit on main
│
├── Multiple commits, multiple concerns
│   └── Split into separate PRs first
│
├── Co-authored by multiple developers
│   └── Merge commit → Preserves all authors
│
└── Hotfix for production
    └── Fast-track: squash merge with hotfix label
```

### PR Review Depth Selection

```
What's the risk level?
├── Low (docs, config, tests, formatting)
│   └── Shallow review: correctness, consistency
│
├── Medium (feature, refactor, dependency update)
│   ├── Standard review: logic, edge cases, tests
│   └── At least 1 reviewer from the affected domain
│
├── High (architecture change, data migration, API change)
│   ├── Deep review: design, security, performance, backward compat
│   └── 2+ reviewers including senior/principal
│
└── Critical (auth, payments, PII, breaking change)
    ├── Full audit: security review + architecture review
    └── Mandatory: 2+ reviewers, load test results, rollback plan
```

## Production Considerations

- **PR size enforcement in CI**: Add a CI check that flags PRs exceeding 400 lines changed. Recommend splitting into smaller PRs with a comment template.
- **Auto-labeling based on commit types**: Parse Conventional Commits in the PR title to auto-apply labels (feat → feature, fix → bug).
- **Changelog generation from PRs**: Use PR labels and titles to auto-generate changelog entries on merge. Reduces release overhead by 80%.
- **PR template validation**: Validate PR description against template requirements before allowing submission. Reduce incomplete PRs by 50%.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Correct Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Leaving PR body empty | Reviewer has zero context about the change | Always use template with what/why/how sections |
| Combining refactor + feature in one PR | Hard to review, risky to revert | Separate PRs: refactor first, feature second |
| Requesting review from everyone | No one feels responsible | Request 1-2 specific reviewers with context |
| Merging without resolving comments | Discussion items remain open | Require all conversations resolved before merge |
| Title doesn't match content | Confusing in changelog and git log | Title must match Conventional Commits format |
| No screenshots for UI changes | Reviewer must run code to see visual impact | Always include before/after screenshots |
| PR that "also fixes" unrelated bugs | Scope creep complicates review | File separate issues, separate PRs |

## Performance Optimization

- **Pre-populate PR description from commits**: Extract commit messages, file list, and diff stats automatically. Saves developer 5-10 minutes per PR.
- **CI-integrated PR size analysis**: Automatically suggest file splits when PR exceeds 400 lines. Flag files with disproportionate change ratio.
- **Template auto-fill**: Use HEAD commit message to pre-fill PR title and type. Use git diff to list all changed files. Developer only writes description.

## Security Considerations

### Sensitive Data in PRs
- **Credential scanning**: Scan diffs for API keys, tokens, passwords before PR submission. Use pre-commit hooks with tools like detect-secrets or truffleHog.
- **Environment file review**: Flag .env additions, config files with secrets. Require second reviewer for any credential-related changes.
- **Screenshot sanitization**: Blur sensitive data in UI screenshots. Never include real PII, tokens, or internal URLs in images.

### Code Review Security Gates
- **Dependency changes**: Highlight new dependencies for security review. Flag direct vs transitive dependency additions.
- **Permission changes**: Flag changes to IAM roles, ACLs, RBAC configs. Require security team approval for permission escalations.
- **Cryptography changes**: Flag new encryption/hashing implementations. Require crypto review for custom algorithms.

### CI/CD Security
- **PR metadata exposure**: Strip sensitive CI variables from PR description and comments. Avoid pasting raw stack traces with internal paths.
- **External contributor safety**: Use separate CI pipeline with restricted permissions for fork PRs. Mask secrets in public fork runs.
- **Signed commits**: Enforce commit signing (GPG/SSH) in PR requirements. Automatically label unsigned commits as unverified.
