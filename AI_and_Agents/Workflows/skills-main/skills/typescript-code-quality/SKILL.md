description: Use when writing or refactoring TypeScript for maintainability, honest types, low-cardinality domain models, explicit error handling, and strong module boundaries.

# TypeScript Code Quality

## Preserve Local Reasoning

Code supports local reasoning when behavior is fully determined by inputs and type signature, with no hidden dependencies. You can understand and change it with confidence.

Implicit dependencies break local reasoning:

- Shared mutable state: globals, singletons, module-level vars, mutable class fields
- Action at a distance: event emitters, pub/sub, observer patterns
- Implicit ordering: must call `init()` before `process()`
- Non-local control flow: exceptions thrown deep and caught far away
- Ambient authority: reading env vars, clock, network, filesystem
- Type lies: `any`, unchecked casts, or `string` that must be a specific format

Explicit dependencies limit blast radius to callers. Honest signatures let the compiler catch contract breaks.

## Prefer Simple Monomorphic Designs

Model the behavior that exists now with one clear shape. Add branches, options, modes, hooks, or extension points only for current callers or inputs.

Prefer required fields and straight-line logic with named intermediate data. Avoid optional params, nullable fields, flags, callbacks, generic knobs, config objects, polymorphic helpers, and conditional logic added for future flexibility.

Before adding a branch or option, name the real case that needs it. If there is none, keep the API monomorphic. When a second case appears, introduce a discriminated union, separate function, or small adapter at that boundary.

## Separate Side Effects from Pure Logic

Push I/O, network calls, filesystem access, DB writes, logging, clock access, and framework integration to the edges. Domain logic should stay pure.

Good shape:

1. Read inputs
2. Build a pure plan
3. Execute the plan

Avoid:

- Mixing fetch/write/log calls into transformation logic
- Hidden mutation inside utility functions
- Business logic embedded in framework handlers

## Separate Control Flow from Data Flow

Keep orchestration code distinct from transformation code.

Prefer:

- Orchestrators that answer: in what order do steps happen?
- Pure helpers that answer: how is data transformed?
- Data structures that make decisions explicit

Avoid:

- Branch-heavy functions that both decide and mutate
- Recomputing the same derived state in multiple places

Small & scoped inline transformations are fine. Do not extract a function that is used only once unless the code is significantly complex, benefits from a named abstraction for domain clarity, or relies on locally mutable variables that should be isolated.

## Prefer Functional Patterns over Stateful OO

Default to functions and data structures unless objects clearly reduce complexity.

## Build Modules with Clear APIs

Each module should have one job and expose a small surface area.

Module boundaries should make it obvious:

- what goes in
- what comes out
- what side effects happen
- what invariants are guaranteed

Avoid:

- Leaking transport/framework types across layers
- Requiring callers to understand internal representation details

## never Pass More Parameters Than Needed

A function signature is part of its contract. Pass only the values the function actually needs to do its job.

Avoid: Passing a whole object when the function reads only one or two fields, accepting broad bags of dependencies or options, and passing values irrelevant to the callee.

Prefer narrow signatures. If a function needs many inputs, first ask whether it is doing too much, whether those inputs form a meaningful domain value, or whether the caller should compute a smaller intermediate value before calling it.

## Import Paths Encode Module Boundaries

- Relative imports (`./`, `./sub/`): private code within the current directory or direct children
- Absolute imports: public APIs from other modules
- Avoid `../` across module boundaries: use absolute imports for public APIs when the repo supports them

## Honest Type Safety

Types must match runtime reality. Do not silence the compiler to bypass a real contract.

Avoid:

- `any`, unchecked `as` assertions, non-null assertions (`!`), vague catch-all types, and broad `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error`
- Casts around untrusted input: JSON, network responses, database rows, env vars, messages

Allowed: `as const` for literal narrowing. Unavoidable assertions around broken external types must be tiny, adapter-local, and downstream of validation.

Prefer:

- `unknown` at trust boundaries, decoded with type guards or schemas
- Discriminated unions, branded/refined types, and exhaustive switches
- `satisfies` for checked literals
- Explicit handling for `Map.get`, `Array.find`, indexed access, and optional fields
- Small adapters around weakly typed libraries

Model expected failures as data. Validation errors, parse errors, missing data, permission failures, conflicts, and retryable external failures should appear in return types as `Result<T, E>` or domain-specific discriminated unions.

Throw only for unexpected situations: violated invariants, impossible states, programmer misuse, corrupted process state, or failures this layer cannot sensibly model. Catch as `unknown`, narrow before reading, and preserve causes when wrapping exceptions.

## Use Discriminated Unions over Optional Properties

Type cardinality is the number of possible values a type admits. Keep type cardinality as low as possible: every value the type admits should be a valid domain state.

Discriminated unions keep type cardinality aligned with runtime cardinality. Each variant should have all its valid properties required, not optional.

Avoid:

```ts
type Result<T> = { type: "success" | "error"; data?: T; error?: Error };
```

This allows invalid runtime states like `{ type: "success", error: new Error() }` and obscures which properties are valid for each type.

Prefer:

```ts
type Result<T> = { type: "success"; data: T } | { type: "error"; error: Error };
```

Each variant is a complete, valid shape. The type system and runtime are in sync.

Avoid optional properties unless the property is genuinely optional in that exact variant. Do not use `?` to encode lifecycle states, variants, or sometimes-required fields.

## Practical Heuristics

- Prefer declarative collection transforms (`map`, `filter`, `flatMap`) over manual accumulation when they make intent clearer.
- Use local mutation only for measured performance needs, clearer imperative algorithms, or inherently mutating APIs. Isolate it tightly.
- Create intermediate data structures when they make the logic easier to name, inspect, or test.
- Avoid conditional logic that serves no current purpose. Keep the current path monomorphic until a real second case exists.
- Encode important logic with typed data and explicit branches, not string conventions or ad hoc conditionals.
