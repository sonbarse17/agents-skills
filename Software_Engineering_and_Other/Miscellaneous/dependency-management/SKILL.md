# Dependency Management

## Purpose
Automate dependency updates, vulnerability scanning, and policy enforcement with Dependabot and Renovate.

## Agent Protocol

### Trigger
Exact user phrases: "Dependabot", "Renovate", "dependencies", "lock file", "vulnerability scanning", "update strategy", "dependabot.yml", "dependency bump", "automated updates", "version pinning", "patch management", "supply chain security", "SBOM", "npm audit".

### Input Context
- Package ecosystem (npm, pip, maven, go, cargo, nuget, docker, terraform).
- Package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, pip, poetry, maven, gradle, go, cargo).
- Automation tool (Dependabot, Renovate, or both).
- Update cadence (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Vulnerability severity threshold (critical only, high+, all).

### Output Artifact
Writes to .github/dependabot.yml, renovate.json, or .github/renovate.json.

### Response Format
dependabot.yml or renovate.json with no extraneous explanation.

No preamble. No postamble. No explanations. No filler/hedging/transitions.

### Completion Criteria
- Dependabot or Renovate configured for the project's ecosystems.
- Update schedule and strategy defined.
- Auto-merge rules configured for safe updates.
- Vulnerability scanning enabled with alerting.
- Lock file committed and kept up-to-date.

## Architecture / Decision Trees

### Tool Selection: Dependabot vs Renovate

| Feature | Dependabot | Renovate |
|---|---|---|
| Configuration | YAML (dependabot.yml) | JSON (renovate.json) |
| Auto-merge | Via GitHub Actions | Built-in (platformAutomerge) |
| Grouped updates | Manual allow lists | Automatic grouping rules |
| Custom registries | Limited | Extensive (any host) |
| Onboarding PR | No | Yes (configurable) |
| Regex manager | No | Yes (Docker, custom) |
| Presets/shared config | No (org-level only) | Presets, extends, shareable |
| Lock file maintenance | Manual | Built-in schedule |
| Dashboard | Dependencies tab only | Dependency Dashboard PR |
| Rate limiting | GitHub API limits | Configurable concurrency |
| Monorepo support | Per-directory config | Automatic workspace detection |
| Self-hosted | Via GitHub | Via Renovate self-hosted |

### Update Strategy Decision Tree
- Major version updates: manual review with quarterly batch.
- Minor version updates: auto-merge after CI passes, weekly batch.
- Patch updates: auto-merge within 3 days, no batch delay.
- Security fixes: immediate PR, direct assign to security team.
- Dev dependencies: weekly batch, auto-merge patch/minor.
- Direct dependencies (production): manual review for major, auto-merge for minor/patch.

### Vulnerability Severity Thresholds

| Severity | Response | SLA | Assignee |
|---|---|---|---|
| Critical | Emergency patch, immediate PR | 24 hours | Security team |
| High | Prioritized patch within 7 days | 7 days | Security + dev team |
| Medium | Patch within next release cycle | 30 days | Dev team |
| Low | Patch within next major | 90 days | Dev team |

### Auto-Merge Risk Assessment

| Update Type | Auto-Merge | Requires | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| Patch (devDeps) | Yes | CI passes | Low |
| Patch (dependencies) | Yes | CI + code coverage | Low |
| Minor (devDeps) | Yes | CI passes | Medium |
| Minor (dependencies) | Conditional | CI + review if breaking | Medium |
| Major (any) | Never | Manual review required | High |
| Security (any) | Conditional | CI + security team review | High |

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Dependabot Configuration
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
      day: "monday"
      time: "09:00"
      timezone: "America/New_York"
    versioning-strategy: "increase-if-necessary"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    rebase-strategy: "auto"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "npm"
    reviewers:
      - "team-devs"
    assignees:
      - "bot-owner"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "fix"
      prefix-development: "chore"
      include: "scope"
    allow:
      - dependency-type: "direct"
    ignore:
      - dependency-name: "react"
        versions: [">=19.0.0"]
      - dependency-name: "typescript"
        update-types: ["version-update:semver-major"]

      interval: "weekly"

  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    groups:
      actions:
        patterns:
          - "actions/*"
          - "github/codeql-action/*"
```

### Step 2: Renovate Configuration
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": [
    "config:recommended",
    ":dependencyDashboard",
    ":semanticCommits",
    "group:allNonMajor"
  ],
  "labels": ["dependencies", "renovate"],
  "assigneesFromCodeOwners": true,
  "schedule": ["before 9am on monday"],

    "assignees": ["security-team"]
  },
  "prConcurrentLimit": 5,
  "prHourlyLimit": 2,
  "osvVulnerabilityAlerts": true
}
```

### Step 3: Auto-Merge Workflow
```yaml
name: Auto-merge Dependencies
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled, opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  auto-merge:
    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'automerge')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22
          cache: npm
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: pascalgn/automerge-action@v0.16.4
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}
```

### Step 4: Vulnerability Scanning
```yaml
name: Vulnerability Scan
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 6 * * *"
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22
          cache: npm
      - run: npm audit --audit-level=high

  sbom:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: advanced-security/sbom-generator-action@v0.0.1
        id: sbom
      - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: ${{ steps.sbom.outputs.sbomPath }}

  trivy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          scan-type: fs
          scan-ref: .
          format: sarif
          output: trivy-results.sarif
          severity: CRITICAL,HIGH
      - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: trivy-results.sarif
```

### Step 5: Lock File Policy
```
# .gitattributes - ensure lock files are treated as binary for PR diffs
package-lock.json binary
yarn.lock binary
pnpm-lock.yaml binary
Cargo.lock binary
go.sum binary
Gemfile.lock binary
```

### Step 6: SBOM Generation
```yaml
name: SBOM Generation
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0"

jobs:
  generate-sbom:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: CycloneDX/gh-node-module-generatebom@v2
        with:
          path: .
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: sbom
          path: bom.xml
```

### Step 7: Dependency Review in CI
```yaml
name: Dependency Review
on: [pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  dependency-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/dependency-review-action@v4
        with:
          fail-on-severity: high
          license-check: true
          deny-licenses: GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0
          comment-summary-in-pr: always
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Ignoring Lock Files
.gitignoring lock files means builds are non-reproducible and vulnerability scans are inaccurate. Lock files are the source of truth for what is actually installed. Always commit lock files.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Auto-Merging Major Updates
Major version bumps often contain breaking API changes that break builds silently. Auto-merging bypasses review. Always require manual review for major version updates.

### Anti-Pattern 3: No Vulnerability Alerting
Without vulnerability scanning and alerting, critical security patches go unnoticed. An unpatched CVE in a production dependency can lead to exploitation. Enable and monitor vulnerability alerts.

### Anti-Pattern 4: Not Pinning GitHub Actions
Using @v1 or @main for GitHub Actions means the action can change without notice, potentially breaking CI or introducing supply chain vulnerabilities. Pin to SHA or full semver tag.

### Anti-Pattern 5: Too Many Open PRs
Dependabot or Renovate opens 50+ PRs overwhelming CI and reviewers. Set open-pull-requests-limit or prConcurrentLimit. Use grouped updates to reduce PR count.

### Anti-Pattern 6: Ignoring Transitive Dependencies
Auditing only direct dependencies misses vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies. Use npm audit, Dependabot alerts (which scan the full tree), or Renovate vulnerability alerts with OSV.

### Anti-Pattern 7: No Update Schedule
Running updates daily creates noise. Running updates monthly misses critical security patches. Weekly schedule with security alerts on-demand is the recommended balance.

## Production Considerations

### Supply Chain Security
- Pin all dependency versions (never ranges like ^1.2.3 in production).
- Use lock files for deterministic installs.
- Sign commits and tags from Dependabot/Renovate.
- Scan for malicious packages (Socket.dev, npm audit, Snyk).
- Maintain an SBOM for every release.
- Enable Dependabot security updates for critical and high alerts.

### CI Integration
- Run npm audit / pip audit in CI on every PR.
- Fail CI on critical and high vulnerabilities.
- Block PRs that add dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
- Require SBOM generation in release pipeline.
- Validate dependency licenses in CI.

### Monorepo Strategy
- One Dependabot config per monorepo with per-directory updates.
- Renovate auto-detects workspaces (npm, pnpm, lerna).
- Use Renovate packageRules with matchFileNames for subdirectories.
- Group updates by workspace to reduce PR count.

## Rules
- Always commit lock files -- never .gitignore them.
- Never auto-merge major version updates without manual review.
- Pin GitHub Action versions to SHA for supply chain security.
- Enable vulnerability alerts for all production dependencies.
- Use grouped updates (Renovate) or allow rules (Dependabot) to reduce PR noise.
- Set open-pull-requests-limit / prConcurrentLimit to avoid overwhelming CI.
- Configure schedule during business hours to avoid weekend CI usage.
- Use Renovate presets for org-wide standardization.
- Enable lock file maintenance for regular lock file updates.
- Use dependency review action in CI to block vulnerable PRs.
- Maintain SBOM for compliance and incident response.
- Set vulnerability SLA: critical = 24h, high = 7d, medium = 30d.
- Use OSV database for comprehensive vulnerability coverage.

## Compared With

### Dependabot vs Renovate vs Manual
Dependabot: simplest setup, GitHub-native, limited customization. Renovate: more configurable, grouped updates, regex manager, self-hostable. Manual: outdated immediately, no vulnerability alerting, human error prone. Start with Dependabot for simple projects, Renovate for complex monorepos.

### npm audit vs Snyk vs Trivy
npm audit: built-in, free, limited to npm ecosystem. Snyk: broader language coverage, fix PRs, license checks, paid. Trivy: open-source, fast, covers filesystem, containers, repos, SBOM. Use npm audit as baseline, Trivy for CI scanning, Snyk for enterprise.

### Lock Files by Ecosystem
npm (package-lock.json): npm standard, deterministic. yarn (yarn.lock): yarn specific. pnpm (pnpm-lock.yaml): pnpm specific, efficient disk. Cargo.lock: Rust standard. go.sum: Go standard, checksum only. Gemfile.lock: Ruby standard. poetry.lock: Python poetry.

## Operations & Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- Review open dependency PRs and merge safe ones.
- Check vulnerability alerts and update SLAs.
- Monitor Renovate/Dependabot dashboard for issues.

### Monthly Tasks
- Review update configuration for new ecosystems.
- Update Renovate/Dependabot to latest version.
- Audit SBOM generation outputs.

### Quarterly Tasks
- Review dependency licensing.
- Audit transitive dependency footprint.
- Update dependency policies based on new supply chain threats.
- Test rollback of dependency update scenarios.

## Architecture Decision Trees

### Automated vs Manual Updates

| Decision | Automated (Dependabot/Renovate) | Manual Updates |
|---|---|---|
| Update frequency | Daily/Weekly PRs | Quarterly releases |
| Breaking changes | Automated major bump PRs | Manual review per package |
| CI requirement | Must pass test suite per PR | Full regression suite |
| Team size | Any | Small teams (< 5) |
| Risk profile | Low to moderate | High (accumulated drift) |
| Maintenance burden | Low (bot handles PRs) | High (scheduled upgrade weeks) |

### Monorepo vs Polyrepo Dependency Strategy

| Aspect | Monorepo | Polyrepo |
|---|---|---|
| Shared dep updates | Single lockfile, atomic | Per-repo, coordinated releases |
| Version conflicts | Single version constraint | Multiple, drift possible |
| CI complexity | Single pipeline | N pipelines, matrix builds |
| Publishing | Internal packages first | External registry needed |

## Implementation Patterns

### YAML: Renovate Configuration for Monorepo

```yaml
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": [
    "config:base",
    ":separateMajorMinor",
    ":combinePatchMinorUpdates",
    "group:monorepos",
    "schedule:weekly"
  ],
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "matchUpdateTypes": ["minor", "patch"],
      "matchCurrentVersion": ">=1.0.0",
      "automerge": true,
      "automergeType": "pr",
      "platformAutomerge": true
    },
    {
      "matchDepTypes": ["devDependencies"],
      "automerge": true,
      "schedule": ["before 9am on Monday"]
    },
    {
      "matchPackageNames": ["react", "react-dom"],
      "groupName": "React Core",
      "labels": ["frontend", "react"]
    },
    {
      "matchManagers": ["dockerfile"],
      "enabled": true,
      "schedule": ["before 9am on Monday"]
    }
  ],
  "vulnerabilityAlerts": {
    "enabled": true,
    "labels": ["security"]
  },
  "lockFileMaintenance": {
    "enabled": true,
    "schedule": ["before 9am on Monday"]
  }
}
```

### Bash: Dependency Audit Script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

audit_dependencies() {
  local manifest=$1

  case "$manifest" in
    package.json)
      npm audit --json > audit-report.json
      jq '.vulnerabilities | to_entries | map(select(.value.severity == "critical")) | length' audit-report.json
      ;;
    pom.xml)
      mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check \
        -DfailBuildOnCVSS=7 \
        -Dformat=JSON
      ;;
    requirements.txt)
      pip-audit --desc on --format json > audit-report.json
      ;;
  esac
}
```

## Production Considerations

- Use **lockfiles** (`package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`, `requirements.txt` hashes) to pin transitive deps
- Configure **Dependency Dashboard** in Renovate to track all pending updates in one place
- Set **update schedules** to avoid peak hours: `schedule:before 9am on Monday`
- Implement **canary deploys** after major dependency upgrades to catch regressions in production
- Monitor **deprecation warnings** from package registries and plan migrations proactively
- Keep a **dependency changelog** to communicate breaking changes to downstream consumers
- Use **internal package registries** (Verdaccio, JFrog Artifactory) to cache external dependencies

## Anti-Patterns

- Using **`latest`** tags in Docker or npm — always pin to exact semver ranges
- Ignoring **peer dependency warnings** — they cause runtime failures in shared libraries
- Running **`npm update`** without review — batch updates hide breaking changes
- Excluding **transitive dependencies** from security scanning — vulnerabilities hide in nested deps
- Keeping **abandoned packages** as dependencies — removes the ability to get security patches
- Mixing **lockfiles** across environments — commit the lockfile and regenerate on CI
- Applying **automated patches** without running the full test suite — causes silent regressions

## Performance Optimization

- Use **npm ci** instead of `npm install` in CI for deterministic, faster installs (skips resolution)
- Implement **tree-shaking** via bundler configuration to eliminate unused dependencies
- Deduplicate **versions** with `npm dedupe` or Yarn constraints to reduce bundle size
- Enable **pnpm** or **Yarn PnP** (Plug'n'Play) for faster installs and less disk usage
- Configure **dependency caching** in CI pipelines to skip re-downloading unchanged packages
- Use **sub-imports / deep imports** to import only needed modules instead of entire libraries
- Split **monorepo packages** into granular modules so consumers only install what they use

## Security Considerations

- Enable **Dependabot security alerts** and auto-merge only patch-level security fixes
- Scan **SBOM** (SPDX/CycloneDX) against NVD database in every CI pipeline
- Rotate **npm/GitHub tokens** with minimal scopes (read:packages, no write access on CI)
- Use **`.npmrc`** with `engine-strict=true` and `ignore-scripts=false` to block postinstall exploits
- Implement **package signing** verification for internal packages with Sigstore
- Monitor **supply chain attacks** by reviewing new dependency maintainers and recent commits
- Block **known malicious packages** with blocklists in the internal registry proxy
