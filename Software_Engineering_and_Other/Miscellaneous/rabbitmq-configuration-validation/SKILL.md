# RabbitMQ Configuration Validation

## Purpose

A RabbitMQ queue declared without `durable=true`, without a queue type
argument, or without any length/TTL bound will accept traffic happily in
staging and only reveal the gap in production — as messages lost on a
routine broker restart, a queue that isn't actually mirrored/replicated
the way an on-call engineer assumes during an [incident](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md), or an unbounded
queue that eventually pushes the whole broker over its memory watermark.
This skill is a concrete pre-production checklist for catching those gaps
before go-live, building on the topology decisions made in
[rabbitmq-configuration](../[rabbitmq-configuration](../../Databases/rabbitmq-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md) rather than
re-deriving them.

## When to use

- Before promoting a newly declared queue/exchange topology from staging
  to production.
- Reviewing a pull request or infra-as-code change that declares or
  alters RabbitMQ queues, exchanges, or vhost permissions.
- Auditing an existing RabbitMQ deployment for durability or
  high-availability gaps against an organizational baseline.
- As a gate in a CI/CD pipeline that provisions RabbitMQ topology via a
  definitions JSON import, Terraform, or a custom provisioning script.
- Confirming a queue advertised as "highly available" actually has the
  replica count/quorum settings needed to back that claim.

## Prerequisites & environment

- Read access to the target broker's topology via the management HTTP
  API or `rabbitmqctl`/`rabbitmq-diagnostics`.
- A documented organizational baseline for production readiness (minimum
  queue durability, required queue type for HA, required length/TTL
  bounds, dead-letter policy requirement) — this skill validates
  *against* such a baseline, established alongside the design guidance in
  [rabbitmq-configuration](../[rabbitmq-configuration](../../Databases/rabbitmq-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).
- RabbitMQ 3.8+ if quorum queues are part of the baseline (see
  version-dependency note in
  [rabbitmq-configuration](../[rabbitmq-configuration](../../Databases/rabbitmq-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)).
- Visibility into publisher code (or at least its `BasicProperties`/
  message-publishing configuration) to validate message persistence, not
  just queue-level durability, since the two are independent.

## Step-by-step guidance

1. **Pull the actual declared queue arguments, not just the intended
   design** — a queue can be re-declared with different arguments by
   mistake if a name collides with an existing queue of a different
   type:
   ```bash
   rabbitmqadmin list queues name durable type arguments
   ```
   Confirm `durable` is `true` and `type` (or the `x-queue-type`
   argument) matches what was intended for every production queue —
   RabbitMQ silently ignores a re-declaration attempt with different
   arguments against an existing queue rather than erroring in a way
   every client library surfaces clearly, so a queue actually running
   `classic` when the design called for `quorum` can go unnoticed without
   this direct check.

2. **Validate every HA-designated queue actually has more than one
   replica**, not just the queue type set correctly:
   ```bash
   rabbitmq-diagnostics check_running
   rabbitmqctl list_queues name type leader members
   ```
   A quorum queue with `members` showing only a single node provides no
   real failure tolerance despite being declared `type=quorum` — this
   happens when `x-quorum-initial-group-size` was omitted or set to 1,
   or when the cluster itself only has one reachable node at
   declaration time. Validation must check the *actual* replica count,
   not just the queue-type label.

3. **Validate message persistence on the publisher side for any queue
   marked durable**, since queue durability alone is not sufficient (see
   the pitfall in
   [rabbitmq-configuration](../[rabbitmq-configuration](../../Databases/rabbitmq-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)):
   ```bash
   # inspect a sample of in-flight messages via the management API
   curl -u <RABBITMQ_USER>:<RABBITMQ_PASSWORD> \
     -X POST http://rabbitmq:15672/api/queues/orders-service/orders.fulfillment.us-east/get \
     -d '{"count":5,"ackmode":"peek","encoding":"auto"}'
   ```
   Confirm `properties.delivery_mode` is `2` (persistent) on sampled
   messages for any queue where restart-survival matters; a durable
   queue full of `delivery_mode: 1` messages is a validation failure,
   not a pass.

4. **Validate every production queue has a bounded length or TTL, and an
   explicit overflow/dead-letter policy**, rather than being left
   unbounded by omission:
   ```bash
   rabbitmqadmin declare policy name=orders-fulfillment-limits \
     pattern="^orders\.fulfillment\." apply-to=queues \
     definition='{"max-length":100000,"overflow":"reject-publish","message-ttl":86400000}'
   ```
   An unbounded queue is a latent [incident](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md): it will eventually either
   exhaust broker memory/disk (tripping the cluster-wide watermark
   described in
   [rabbitmq-configuration](../[rabbitmq-configuration](../../Databases/rabbitmq-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)) or grow
   large enough that consumer catch-up becomes impractical. Validation
   should flag any production queue with no `max-length`,
   `max-length-bytes`, or `message-ttl` policy applied.

5. **Validate a dead-letter exchange is configured for any queue where
   poison messages are plausible**, rather than discovering the absence
   during an [incident](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md):
   ```bash
   rabbitmqadmin declare policy name=orders-fulfillment-dlx \
     pattern="^orders\.fulfillment\." apply-to=queues \
     definition='{"dead-letter-exchange":"orders.dlx","dead-letter-routing-key":"orders.fulfillment.dead"}'
   ```
   Confirm the referenced dead-letter exchange (`orders.dlx`) and its
   bound queue actually exist — a policy referencing a non-existent
   dead-letter exchange fails silently: rejected messages are simply
   dropped rather than routed anywhere, which validation must catch by
   checking both sides of the reference, not just the policy's presence.
   Diagnosing dead-letter queues that are filling up unexpectedly is
   covered in
   [rabbitmq-queue-and-dead-letter-troubleshooting](../[rabbitmq-queue-and-dead-letter-troubleshooting](../rabbitmq-queue-and-dead-letter-troubleshooting/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

6. **Validate vhost permission scoping is least-privilege**, not a
   blanket grant:
   ```bash
   rabbitmqctl list_permissions -p orders-service
   ```
   Flag any user whose configure/write/read permission regex is `.*`
   (unrestricted) rather than scoped to the application's actual naming
   prefix — a validation pass should require permission patterns scoped
   to the specific resource-naming convention, matching the isolation
   guidance in
   [rabbitmq-configuration](../[rabbitmq-configuration](../../Databases/rabbitmq-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

7. **If topology is provisioned via a definitions JSON import or
   Terraform, diff the plan against the current broker state as an
   explicit CI gate**:
   ```bash
   rabbitmqadmin export /tmp/current-definitions.json
   diff <(jq -S . /tmp/current-definitions.json) <(jq -S . proposed-definitions.json)
   ```
   A diff showing a queue's `durable` flipping from `true` to `false`,
   or a `queue-type` argument disappearing, should block the apply until
   reconciled — these are exactly the changes most likely to be an
   accidental regression rather than an intended change.

## Best practices

- Encode the production baseline (required durability, required queue
  type for HA-designated queues, required length/TTL bound, required
  dead-letter policy) as an automated check (a script against the
  management API, or an OPA/Conftest policy over exported definitions
  JSON) rather than a manual checklist re-read each time.
- Validate the *actual* replica count for HA queues, not just the
  `queue-type` label — a quorum queue with one member is not actually
  highly available.
- Validate publisher-side message persistence alongside queue
  durability; they are independent settings and both need checking.
- Require every production queue to have an explicit length/TTL bound
  and a dead-letter exchange, treating an unbounded queue as a finding,
  not a neutral default.
- Re-run validation after any policy change (length limits, dead-letter
  routing, HA parameters) — policies can be altered independently of the
  queue declaration itself and drift silently otherwise.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** A queue policy references a dead-letter exchange that
  validation confirms is declared, but rejected messages still
  disappear rather than landing in the expected dead-letter queue.
  **Fix:** Check that the dead-letter exchange has an actual binding to
  a queue with a routing key matching `dead-letter-routing-key` (or the
  original message's routing key, if unset) — a dead-letter exchange
  that exists but has no matching binding silently drops the message,
  the same way an unbound regular exchange would. Validation must check
  the full chain (policy → exchange → binding → queue), not just that
  the exchange name resolves.

- **Symptom:** A queue intended as highly available is declared with
  `x-queue-type: quorum` and passes a validation check that only greps
  for the queue-type argument, but during an [incident](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) it turns out the
  queue has a single member and goes fully unavailable when its one node
  restarts.
  **Fix:** Validation that checks only for the presence of
  `x-queue-type: quorum` without checking `list_queues ... members` gives
  a false pass. Always validate the actual current replica count against
  the cluster's node count, not just the declared type.

- **Symptom:** A durable queue with persistent messages still loses data
  on a *planned* maintenance restart of the whole cluster (not a single
  node).
  **Fix:** Durability and persistence protect against individual broker
  restarts assuming at least one replica survives — a full-cluster
  restart taken all at once, without a rolling/staggered approach, can
  still cause quorum queues to lose availability mid-restart if the
  restart brings down a majority of a queue's replicas simultaneously.
  Validate that any planned full-cluster maintenance uses a rolling
  restart, one node at a time, confirming quorum-queue leaders have
  failed over cleanly between each node's restart.

- **Symptom:** An "unbounded" queue with no `max-length` policy validated
  as acceptable months ago now holds tens of millions of messages after
  a long-running consumer outage, and the broker's disk watermark trips,
  blocking publishing cluster-wide.
  **Fix:** This is exactly what the length/TTL-bound validation step is
  meant to catch — re-run validation periodically (not just at initial
  rollout) against queues that may have been created or had policies
  changed since the last [audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md), and treat any unbounded production queue
  discovered later as a finding requiring the same remediation as if
  caught at go-live.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** A pre-production review of the `orders.fulfillment.us-east`
quorum queue (declared in
[rabbitmq-configuration](../[rabbitmq-configuration](../../Databases/rabbitmq-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)'s worked
example) before it goes live.

Queue state pulled for review:
```bash
$ rabbitmqctl list_queues name type leader members -p orders-service
orders.fulfillment.us-east  quorum  rabbit@rmq-node-1  [rabbit@rmq-node-1,rabbit@rmq-node-2,rabbit@rmq-node-3]
```
Replica count check passes: 3 members across the cluster's 3 nodes,
matching the design's `x-quorum-initial-group-size: 3`.

Length/TTL and dead-letter policy check:
```bash
$ rabbitmqctl list_policies -p orders-service
vhost            name                          pattern                     definition
orders-service   orders-fulfillment-limits     ^orders\.fulfillment\.      {"max-length":100000,"overflow":"reject-publish"}
```
This fails validation: a `max-length` is set, but no `message-ttl` or
dead-letter-exchange policy is present — messages hitting the length
limit are rejected outright (`reject-publish`) rather than routed
anywhere for inspection, meaning a backlog spike silently drops orders
instead of surfacing them. Review requests adding a dead-letter policy
before sign-off:
```bash
rabbitmqadmin declare policy name=orders-fulfillment-dlx \
  pattern="^orders\.fulfillment\." apply-to=queues \
  definition='{"dead-letter-exchange":"orders.dlx","dead-letter-routing-key":"orders.fulfillment.dead","max-length":100000}'

rabbitmqadmin declare exchange name=orders.dlx type=fanout durable=true
rabbitmqadmin declare queue name=orders.fulfillment.dead durable=true
rabbitmqadmin declare binding source=orders.dlx destination=orders.fulfillment.dead
```
Publisher persistence check via the management API confirms sampled
messages carry `delivery_mode: 2`. With the dead-letter chain added and
verified end-to-end (policy → exchange → binding → queue), the topology
passes validation and is approved for production traffic.
