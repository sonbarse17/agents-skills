  Guides writing Jira comments that actually help the next reader (context,
  decision rationale, links to PRs/commits/deploys), deciding when to
  comment versus when to update a ticket field, and automating
  status/comment updates from CI/CD (e.g. posting a deploy notification
  comment on release) without producing comment spam — including the
  Jira REST API shape for posting comments programmatically
  (`POST /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/comment`). Use when the user
  asks to "add a Jira comment", "post a deploy notification to the
  ticket", "document a decision on this issue", "automate ticket updates
  from the pipeline", or "why is this ticket full of noise".

# Jira Comments and Tracking Automation

## Purpose

Comments are where a ticket's *narrative* lives — why a decision was
made, what was tried and ruled out, what a deploy actually shipped — but
that narrative is only useful if it's written for the next reader, not
as a stream-of-consciousness log for the author. Comments are also the
easiest thing to automate (CI/CD posting a deploy notification, a bot
posting a build-failure link) and the easiest thing to over-automate
into noise that trains people to stop reading them. This skill covers
writing comments that hold up months later, choosing comment vs. field
update for a given piece of state, and building CI/CD-driven comment/
status automation that adds signal instead of drowning it. It assumes
the ticket itself is already well-formed — see
[jira-ticket-best-practices-and-workflow](../[jira-ticket-best-practices-and-workflow](../../../Product_and_Business/jira-ticket-best-practices-and-workflow/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
for writing the ticket and moving it through its workflow. When the
decision or context is significant enough to outlive the ticket, it
belongs in Confluence, not buried in a comment thread — see
[confluence-page-authoring-and-governance](../[confluence-page-authoring-and-governance](../../Frontend/confluence-page-authoring-and-governance/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

## When to use

- Writing a comment to explain a decision, a workaround, or why an
  approach changed mid-ticket.
- Deciding whether a piece of information belongs in a comment or should
  instead update a field (status, fix version, priority, description).
- Designing or reviewing a CI/CD integration that posts to Jira on
  build/deploy/release events.
- Diagnosing why a ticket's comment thread has become noisy/unreadable
  and fixing the automation or convention causing it.
- Restricting comment visibility (internal engineering notes vs.
  customer-facing service-desk portal).

## Prerequisites & environment

- Same API access as ticket creation: `${JIRA_BASE_URL}`,
  `${JIRA_API_TOKEN}` (Cloud API token or Data Center PAT), and a service
  account with "Add Comments" permission scoped to the relevant
  project(s) for automation use cases — do not reuse a personal token
  for a CI pipeline.
- Jira Cloud REST API v3 comment bodies are ADF (Atlassian Document
  Format) JSON, not plain text or markdown — a raw string body will be
  rejected or mis-rendered depending on API version.
- For CI/CD automation, the pipeline needs outbound network access to
  `${JIRA_BASE_URL}` and a stored secret (`${JIRA_API_TOKEN}`) injected
  as a masked pipeline variable, never committed to the repo.
- If comment automation should also change status, confirm the
  workflow's transition IDs per project first — see the transitions
  step in the tickets skill; they are not the same across projects.
- If direct API/webhook access isn't available, Jira Automation (the
  built-in rule engine) or an MCP Jira server can achieve the same
  outcomes without custom REST calls — the guidance on *what* to post
  and *when* applies regardless of the delivery mechanism.

## Step-by-step guidance

1. **Decide comment vs. field update with one question: "does anything
   automated (a dashboard, a report, another workflow) need to read this
   value?"** If yes, it's a field (status, priority, fix version, a
   custom "root cause" field) — comments are free text that reports and
   automations generally can't reliably parse. If it's narrative context
   a human needs to understand *why* a field has the value it has,
   that's a comment.

2. **Structure a decision comment so it stands alone:**
   - **Context** — what question/problem prompted this comment.
   - **Decision** — what was decided or done, stated plainly.
   - **Rationale** — why, including alternatives considered and ruled
     out (this is the part that gets lost if only decided verbally).
   - **Links** — PR, [commit](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) SHA, design doc/Confluence page, related
     ticket.
   Write it as if the next reader has zero memory of the conversation
   that led here — because in six months, they will.

3. **Promote durable decisions out of the comment thread.** If a
   decision materially changes scope, approach, or acceptance criteria,
   also update the ticket's description (or a dedicated "Decision Log"
   Confluence page linked from the ticket) — a comment thread that is
   the *only* record of an architectural decision is one accidental
   thread-collapse or ticket-archival away from being lost.

4. **Post a comment via the REST API:**

   ```http
   POST /rest/api/3/issue/AUTH-2231/comment
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Basic base64(${JIRA_USER_EMAIL}:${JIRA_API_TOKEN})
   ```

   ```json
   {
     "body": {
       "type": "doc",
       "version": 1,
       "content": [
         {
           "type": "paragraph",
           "content": [
             {
               "type": "text",
               "text": "Decision: rolling back the EU IdP config change from AUTH-2231 instead of forward-fixing. Root cause was a clock-skew issue between the IdP and auth-service that forward-fixing would take longer to validate than reverting. See PR #482 for the revert and the [incident](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) notes at "
             },
             {
               "type": "text",
               "text": "the linked Confluence page",
               "marks": [{ "type": "link", "attrs": { "href": "${CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL}/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/123456" } }]
             },
             { "type": "text", "text": " for full timeline." }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

   A successful response is `201 Created` with the new comment's `id` —
   keep it if you need to edit that same comment later instead of
   posting a new one (see step 6).

5. **Restrict visibility when the audience isn't everyone with ticket
   access** (e.g. an internal-only diagnostic on a customer-facing
   service-desk ticket):

   ```json
   {
     "body": { "type": "doc", "version": 1, "content": [ /* ... */ ] },
     "visibility": {
       "type": "role",
       "value": "Administrators"
     }
   }
   ```

   Confirm the exact `visibility` mechanism (role vs. group, and which
   role/group names exist) per instance — this varies between Jira
   Service Management projects and plain software projects.

6. **Design CI/CD comment automation to update, not append.** For a
   pipeline that reports build status repeatedly on the same ticket
   (e.g. lint → build → test → deploy), post one comment at the
   meaningful milestone (deploy) rather than one per stage, or edit a
   single tracked comment in place:

   ```http
   PUT /rest/api/3/issue/AUTH-2231/comment/{commentId}
   Content-Type: application/json
   ```

   ```json
   {
     "body": {
       "type": "doc",
       "version": 1,
       "content": [
         {
           "type": "paragraph",
           "content": [
             { "type": "text", "text": "Deploy status: v2.14.1 deployed to production at 2026-07-28T14:32:00Z. [Commit](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) a91fbc2. Pipeline run: " },
             { "type": "text", "text": "#4821", "marks": [{ "type": "link", "attrs": { "href": "https://ci.example.com/runs/4821" } }] }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

7. **Post a genuinely useful deploy notification, not a log dump.**
   Include: what shipped (version/[commit](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md)), where (environment), when
   (timestamp with timezone), and a link back to the pipeline run and
   the diff/PR — not the raw console output of the build. If the ticket
   needs a status change too (e.g. "In Review" → "Done" once deployed to
   production and verified), do that as a field transition alongside the
   comment, not instead of it.

8. **Prefer the platform's native automation for common triggers.**
   Jira Automation rules ("when PR merged, transition to Done and
   comment with the merge [commit](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md)") or a Jira/Bitbucket/[GitHub](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/CI_CD/github/SKILL.md) smart
   [commit](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) integration often cover the common cases without custom REST
   code, and are easier for a team to [audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md)/maintain than a bespoke
   script. Reach for a custom `POST .../comment` call when the trigger
   or payload shape isn't something the built-in automation supports.

## Best practices

- One comment per meaningful event, not per pipeline stage. If a
  pipeline needs to show granular progress, link to the pipeline UI
  instead of replicating it comment-by-comment in Jira.
- Write comments for someone with no memory of the Slack conversation
  that preceded them — restate the question being answered.
- Use a consistent comment template for recurring automated types (deploy
  notification, test-failure alert) so readers learn to skim them fast.
- Tag people (`@mention`) only when an action is required from them
  specifically — not as a broadcast; overuse trains people to ignore
  mentions.
- When a decision changes the ticket's scope or acceptance criteria,
  update the description/AC as the source of truth and reference the
  comment for rationale — don't leave the AC stale while the "real"
  current plan lives only in a comment three days later.
- Use a dedicated, least-privileged service account for CI/CD-originated
  comments (not a shared admin token) so noisy or misbehaving automation
  is easy to identify and rate-limit.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** An important architectural decision ("we're deprioritizing
  the retry-queue approach in favor of a synchronous call because X")
  exists only as a mid-thread comment. Months later, someone reverses the
  decision because the rationale isn't visible anywhere except a buried
  comment on a closed ticket.
  **Fix:** Promote decisions with lasting consequence into the ticket
  description or a linked Confluence decision record (see
  [confluence-page-authoring-and-governance](../[confluence-page-authoring-and-governance](../../Frontend/confluence-page-authoring-and-governance/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)),
  and treat the comment as the pointer to it, not the sole copy.

- **Symptom:** A CI pipeline posts a new comment for every stage (lint
  ✅, build ✅, unit tests ✅, integration tests ✅...) on every [commit](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md),
  so a ticket accumulates dozens of near-identical automated comments and
  humans stop reading the comment feed entirely — including the one
  comment that actually mattered.
  **Fix:** Post (or edit in place) one comment at a meaningful milestone
  — typically deploy/release — and link out to the full pipeline run for
  detail, per step 6 above.

- **Symptom:** An automated comment dumps a full stack trace or raw log
  output into the ticket, including internal hostnames/paths, and the
  ticket happens to be visible on a customer-facing service-desk portal.
  **Fix:** Set `visibility` on sensitive automated comments (step 5), and
  treat "does this project have an external-facing portal?" as a
  standing question when designing any automation that posts to it.

- **Symptom:** A ticket is transitioned to "Done" by an automation the
  moment a PR merges, before the change is actually deployed/verified —
  so "Done" stops meaning "done" and downstream reporting (release notes,
  deploy tracking) becomes unreliable.
  **Fix:** Gate the Done transition on the actual completion signal
  (deploy succeeded, verified in the target environment), not on a proxy
  event (PR merged) that only correlates with completion.

- **Symptom:** A shared/admin API token used for comment automation gets
  rotated or revoked (e.g. during an offboarding), and every pipeline
  using it silently starts failing to post comments with no clear owner
  to page.
  **Fix:** Use a dedicated service account/token per integration, scoped
  to only the needed permission and project, so failures are attributable
  and rotations don't have unknown blast radius.

## Worked example

**Before — noisy, unhelpful automated comments on `REL-990`:**

```
[bot] Build #4801 started
[bot] Lint passed
[bot] Build #4801 succeeded
[bot] Unit tests passed (312/312)
[bot] Integration tests passed (48/48)
[bot] Build #4801 artifact published
```

Six near-identical lines, no version number, no environment, no link
back to anything useful — and this repeats for every [commit](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md).

**After — a single, edited-in-place deploy comment:**

```
Deploy status: v2.14.1 deployed to production (eu-west-1) at
2026-07-28T14:32:00Z.
[Commit](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md): a91fbc2 ("fix: correct clock-skew tolerance in SSO token
validation", PR #482)
Pipeline run: #4821 (https://ci.example.com/runs/4821)
Verification: smoke test suite green post-deploy; EU login error rate
back to baseline as of 14:40 UTC.
```

Posting/updating that comment via the API:

```http
PUT /rest/api/3/issue/AUTH-2231/comment/10432
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic base64(${JIRA_USER_EMAIL}:${JIRA_API_TOKEN})
```

```json
{
  "body": {
    "type": "doc",
    "version": 1,
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": [
          { "type": "text", "text": "Deploy status: v2.14.1 deployed to production (eu-west-1) at 2026-07-28T14:32:00Z. [Commit](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) a91fbc2 (\"fix: correct clock-skew tolerance in SSO token validation\", PR #482). Pipeline run #4821. Smoke tests green; EU login error rate back to baseline as of 14:40 UTC." }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Followed by the actual status transition (once verified, not before) as
covered in
[jira-ticket-best-practices-and-workflow](../[jira-ticket-best-practices-and-workflow](../../../Product_and_Business/jira-ticket-best-practices-and-workflow/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md):

```json
{ "transition": { "id": "51" } }
```
