# Performance Optimization

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Performance Optimization**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Read-Heavy vs Write-Heavy**: Designing tailored indexes, materialized views, and LSM trees based on access patterns.
- **Database Sharding**: Horizontally partitioning data across nodes using a routing key to bypass vertical scaling limits.
- **Distributed Caching**: Utilizing Redis/Memcached to absorb read-heavy traffic and reduce latency.
- **Saga Pattern**: Managing distributed transactions through a sequence of local transactions and compensating actions.

### Core Implementation

```java
public class CircuitBreaker {
    private AtomicInteger failures = new AtomicInteger(0);
    private final int threshold = 5;
    
    public Response execute(Supplier<Response> action) {
        if (failures.get() >= threshold) throw new CircuitOpenException();
        try {
            Response res = action.get();
            failures.set(0); // Reset on success
            return res;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            failures.incrementAndGet();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Performance Optimization**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Consistent Hashing**: Maps data to nodes using a hash ring, minimizing key redistribution when nodes scale.
- **Event Sourcing**: Storing the state of an application as a sequence of immutable events.
- **Vector Clocks**: Logical clocks used to determine the partial ordering of events in distributed systems.
- **CAP Theorem**: Systems must trade off between Consistency and Availability during network partitions.

### Mathematical Thresholds
$$ \text{Availability} = \frac{\text{MTBF}}{\text{MTBF} + \text{MTTR}} $$
