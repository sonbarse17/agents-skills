# Performance Optimization

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Performance Optimization**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Bloom Filters**: Probabilistic data structures used to rapidly verify if an element definitely does not exist.
- **PACELC Theorem**: An extension of CAP; even without partitions, trade-offs between Latency and Consistency exist.
- **Idempotency Keys**: Ensuring safe retries in distributed networks by preventing duplicate state mutations.

### Core Implementation

```java
public class CircuitBreaker {
    private AtomicInteger failures = new AtomicInteger(0);
    private final int threshold = 5;
    
    public Response execute(Supplier<Response> action) {
        if (failures.get() >= threshold) throw new CircuitOpenException();
        try {
            Response res = action.get();
            failures.set(0); // Reset on success
            return res;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            failures.incrementAndGet();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
