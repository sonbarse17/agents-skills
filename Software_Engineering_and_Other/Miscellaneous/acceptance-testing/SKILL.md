# Acceptance Testing

## Purpose
Validate that the system meets business requirements, user needs, and acceptance criteria through structured UAT, alpha/beta programs, business scenario testing, and automated acceptance tests.

## Agent Protocol

### Trigger
User mentions acceptance testing, UAT, alpha/beta testing, user sign-off, business scenarios, Gherkin scenarios, or specification by example.

### Input Context
- User stories or feature specifications
- Acceptance criteria (Gherkin or otherwise)
- Business process flows
- Target user profiles for beta programs
- Environment availability (staging, production-like)

### Output Artifact
- UAT test scenarios and results
- Alpha/beta feedback reports
- Business scenario coverage matrix
- Signed-off acceptance test report

### Response Format
Structured report with:
1. Test scenarios mapped to user stories/requirements
2. Execution results and status
3. Blocking vs non-blocking issues
4. Sign-off recommendation
5. Risks and open items

### Completion Criteria
- All acceptance criteria exercised AND
- Blocking issues resolved or documented as known deviations AND
- Stakeholder sign-off received OR explicit deferral documented

## Workflow

1. **Analyze requirements**: Extract acceptance criteria from user stories, epics, business flows
2. **Design scenarios**: Create Gherkin scenarios, business flow tests, UAT scripts
3. **Prepare environment**: Configure UAT environment, set up test data, onboard users
4. **Execute**: Run UAT sessions, manage beta programs, execute business scenarios
5. **Evaluate**: Assess results against acceptance criteria, track defects
6. **Sign-off**: Present results to stakeholders, obtain formal acceptance

## Gherkin Scenario Examples

### Positive Scenario
```gherkin
Feature: User Registration
  As a visitor
  I want to register for an account
  So that I can access the platform

  Scenario: Successful registration with valid data
    Given I am on the registration page
    When I enter a valid email "user@example.com"
    And I enter a password meeting complexity requirements
    And I accept the terms of service
    And I submit the registration form
    Then I should see a confirmation message
    And I should receive a verification email at "user@example.com"
    And I should be redirected to the login page
```

### Negative Scenario
```gherkin
Scenario: Registration fails with duplicate email
  Given a user with email "existing@example.com" already exists
  When I enter email "existing@example.com"
  And I enter a valid password
  And I submit the registration form
  Then I should see an error "Email already registered"
  And I should remain on the registration page
```

### Business Rule Scenario
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Discount application by order value
  Given I have a customer account
  When I place an order with value <order_value>
  Then the discount applied should be <discount>

  Examples:
    | order_value | discount |
    | 49.99       | 0        |
    | 50.00       | 10       |
    | 100.00      | 15       |
    | 500.00      | 20       |
```

## Automated Acceptance Tests (Python + pytest-bdd)

```python
# tests/acceptance/test_checkout.py
from pytest_bdd import scenarios, given, when, then, parsers

scenarios("../features/checkout.feature")

@given("I am a logged-in customer with items in my cart")
def logged_in_customer(cart_factory, auth_session):
    return auth_session.login(cart_factory.with_items(3))

@when(parsers.parse('I proceed to checkout with "{payment_method}"'))
def proceed_to_checkout(logged_in_customer, payment_method):
    logged_in_customer.checkout(payment_method=payment_method)

@then("I should see an order confirmation")
def verify_confirmation(logged_in_customer):
    assert logged_in_customer.current_page == "order_confirmation"
    assert logged_in_customer.order_id is not None

@then("my cart should be empty")
def verify_cart_empty(logged_in_customer):
    assert logged_in_in_customer.cart.item_count == 0
```

    - "P0 security vulnerability discovered"
```

## Acceptance Testing Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Testing Without Defined Criteria
Starting acceptance testing without clear, measurable acceptance criteria leads to subjective pass/fail decisions. "System should be fast" is not a criterion — "checkout completes under 5 seconds under normal load" is. Define criteria during sprint planning, not during testing.

### Anti-Pattern: UAT with Developers as Users
Having developers or QA role-play as end users misses real-world usage patterns. Developers know the system too well and subconsciously avoid problematic paths. Recruit actual end users from customer-facing teams or customer panels.

### Anti-Pattern: No Negative Testing
Testing only happy paths (successful login, successful purchase, etc.) misses the majority of real-world issues. Every acceptance criterion must have at least one corresponding negative test. "User cannot register with an invalid email" is as important as "User can register with a valid email."

### Anti-Pattern: Treating All Defects Equally
Blocking acceptance sign-off on minor UI issues while passing critical workflow bugs creates false confidence. Classify defects by severity: P0 (blocks sign-off), P1 (must fix), P2 (should fix), P3 (nice to have). Only P0 and P1 should block release.

### Anti-Pattern: No Traceability to Requirements
Acceptance test results not linked back to specific user stories or requirements make it impossible to assess coverage. Each test scenario must reference the requirement ID. Maintain a traceability matrix.

### Anti-Pattern: One-Time UAT Event
Running UAT as a single event at the end of the sprint instead of continuous validation throughout development. Issues found late are more expensive to fix. Involve stakeholders in sprint reviews and demo incremental progress.

## Acceptance Testing Maturity Model

| Level | Characteristics | Practices |
|---|---|---|
| 1: Initial | No formal acceptance testing | Ad-hoc demos, verbal sign-off, no traceability |
| 2: Defined | Basic UAT with scripts | Manual UAT sessions, Gherkin scenarios for critical paths, spreadsheet tracking |
| 3: Managed | Automated acceptance tests | pytest-bdd/SpecFlow/Cucumber, CI-gated acceptance, traceability matrix |
| 4: Measured | Continuous acceptance validation | Automated acceptance in CI/CD pipeline, metric-driven sign-off, acceptance coverage > 80% |
| 5: Optimized | Shift-left acceptance | Acceptance criteria as executable specifications, BDD-driven development, real-time stakeholder dashboards |

## Performance Considerations

- UAT session length: 1-2 hours max per session. Beyond 2 hours, tester fatigue reduces defect discovery rate.
- Beta test sample size: minimum 100 users for statistically significant results. For NPS measurement, target 380+ responses for ±5% margin of error.
- Automated acceptance test execution: target under 10 minutes. If longer, split into parallel execution streams.
- Feedback analysis ratio: budget 1 hour of analysis per 10 beta feedback submissions.
- Test data setup: budget 30 minutes per UAT session for environment and data preparation.

## Acceptance Testing with Cucumber/SpecFlow

### Java/SpecFlow Example
```gherkin
Feature: Checkout Discounts
  As a customer
  I want discounts applied correctly at checkout
  So that I pay the correct amount

  Scenario Outline: Discount by order value
    Given I have items worth <subtotal> in my cart
    And I am logged in as a <tier> customer
    When I proceed to checkout
    Then the discount displayed should be <discount>
    And the total should be <total>

    Examples:
      | subtotal | tier      | discount | total |
      | 30.00    | standard  | 0        | 30.00 |
      | 75.00    | standard  | 7.50     | 67.50 |
      | 75.00    | premium   | 15.00    | 60.00 |
      | 150.00   | premium   | 30.00    | 120.00 |
```

```csharp
[Binding]
public class CheckoutDiscountSteps
{
    private readonly CheckoutContext _context;

    public CheckoutDiscountSteps(CheckoutContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    [Given(@"I have items worth (.*) in my cart")]
    public void GivenItemsInCart(decimal subtotal)
    {
        _context.Cart = new Cart { Total = subtotal };
    }

    [Given(@"I am logged in as a (.*) customer")]
    public void GivenCustomerTier(string tier)
    {
        _context.CustomerTier = tier;
    }

    [When(@"I proceed to checkout")]
    public void WhenProceedToCheckout()
    {
        _context.Checkout();
    }

    [Then(@"the discount displayed should be (.*)")]
    public void ThenDiscountShouldBe(decimal expected)
    {
        Assert.Equal(expected, _context.AppliedDiscount);
    }
}
```

## CI Integration for Acceptance Tests

```yaml
name: Acceptance Tests
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 5 * * 1-5"  # Weekday morning

jobs:
  acceptance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:16
        env:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: testpass
        ports:
          - 5432:5432
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - name: Seed test data
        run: node scripts/seed-acceptance-data.js
      - name: Run acceptance tests
        run: npx cucumber-js --format json:reports/acceptance.json
      - name: Upload results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: acceptance-report
          path: reports/acceptance.json
```

## Acceptance Testing Anti-Patterns (Additional)

### Anti-Pattern: No Traceability
Acceptance test results not linked back to specific user stories or requirements make it impossible to assess coverage or determine which requirements are met. Each scenario must reference the requirement ID. Maintain a traceability matrix.

### Anti-Pattern: Testing Without Business Stakeholders
Running UAT without actual business stakeholders or end users produces validation without real-world value. Developers know the system too well and subconsciously avoid problematic paths. Recruit actual end users.

### Anti-Pattern: One-Time UAT Event
Running UAT as a single event at the end of the sprint rather than continuous validation throughout development. Issues found late are expensive to fix. Involve stakeholders in sprint reviews. Demo incremental progress.

### Anti-Pattern: Ignoring Non-Functional Requirements
Acceptance criteria focused only on functional behavior while ignoring performance, accessibility, security, and usability. Each story should have non-functional acceptance criteria where applicable. "Page loads under 3 seconds" is a valid acceptance criterion.

## Acceptance Testing Metrics

```yaml
metrics:
  traceability:
    requirements_covered: 45
    requirements_total: 48
    coverage_pct: 93.8%
  execution:
    scenarios_passed: 120
    scenarios_failed: 3
    scenarios_blocked: 2
    pass_rate: 96.0%
  defects:
    by_severity:
      p0_blocking: 0
      p1_high: 1
      p2_medium: 2
      p3_low: 2
    avg_time_to_fix: "2.3 days"
  uat:
    sessions_completed: 6
    total_participants: 12
    avg_satisfaction: 4.2 / 5
    blocking_issues_unresolved: 0
```

## Rules
1. Acceptance criteria must be defined BEFORE testing begins — no testing against ambiguous requirements
2. Every user story must have at least one positive and one negative Gherkin scenario
3. UAT users must represent real user roles — not developers or QA
4. Business scenarios must cover happy path, alternate flows, and exception paths
5. All acceptance test results must be traceable back to specific requirements
6. Blocking defects stop sign-off — document workarounds if accepting with known issues
7. Beta test participant data must be anonymized in all reports
8. Each acceptance scenario maps to exactly one business rule or requirement
9. Regression testing of accepted scenarios runs before each production release
10. Stakeholder sign-off is recorded with explicit acceptance or rejection rationale
11. Non-functional acceptance criteria (performance, accessibility, security) must be defined alongside functional criteria
12. Acceptance test failures must be triaged within 24 hours for blocking defects
13. Beta test exit criteria must be defined before beta launch — not retroactively
14. Automated acceptance tests must target under 10 minutes execution time
15. Each UAT session must have a trained facilitator who is not the developer

## Implementation Patterns

### Observer Pattern for Event Handling
`
interface EventObserver<T> {
  onEvent(event: T): Promise<void>;
}

class EventBus<T> {
  private observers: Set<EventObserver<T>> = new Set();
  subscribe(observer: EventObserver<T>): void {
    this.observers.add(observer);
  }
  unsubscribe(observer: EventObserver<T>): void {
    this.observers.delete(observer);
  }
  async emit(event: T): Promise<void> {
    const results = Array.from(this.observers).map(o => o.onEvent(event));
    await Promise.allSettled(results);
  }
}
`

### Configuration-Driven Approach
`
config:
  defaults:
    timeout: 30s
    retryCount: 3
  overrides:
    production:
      timeout: 60s
      retryCount: 5
    development:
      timeout: 300s
      retryCount: 1
`

## Production Considerations

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Configuration validated against schema before startup
- [ ] Health check endpoints registered and monitored
- [ ] Graceful shutdown with draining period (30s timeout)
- [ ] Resource limits configured (CPU, memory, file descriptors)
- [ ] Log level set appropriate for environment
- [ ] Metrics endpoint secured and exposed
- [ ] Rate limiting configured per-tier
- [ ] TLS certificates valid and auto-renewing
- [ ] Database migrations run as separate deployment step
- [ ] Feature flags ready for gradual rollout

### Monitoring and Alerting
| Metric | Threshold | Severity | Action |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Error rate | > 1% over 5min | Critical | Page on-call |
| p99 latency | > 2s over 5min | Warning | Investigate |
| Throughput drop | > 50% over 1min | Critical | Check upstream |
| Queue depth | > 1000 over 1min | Warning | Scale consumers |
| Disk usage | > 85% | Warning | Clean or expand |
| Memory usage | > 90% heap | Critical | Restart or scale |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Solution |
|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Premature optimization | Complex code for no measured benefit | Guessing instead of profiling | Measure first, optimize based on data |
| Copy-paste reuse | Duplicate code across codebase | Lack of abstraction | Extract shared logic into libraries |
| Gold-plating | Features with no current requirement | Over-engineering | YAGNI — build what's needed now |
| Magical thinking | Assumptions without validation | Skipping error handling | Handle all failure modes explicitly |

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
Cache hierarchy: L1 (in-memory local) → L2 (distributed Redis/Memcached) → L3 (CDN/Edge).
Cache invalidation: TTL-based (simple, stale), event-based (complex, fresh), write-through (consistent, higher write latency), write-behind (fast writes, eventual consistency).

### Resource Pooling
- Database connections: Pool of reusable connections (HikariCP, pgBouncer)
- HTTP connections: Keep-alive + connection pooling for external calls
- Thread pool: Bounded thread pools for async task execution

### Profiling Methodology
1. Establish baseline with production traffic profile
2. Profile CPU with sampling profiler (pprof, perf, async-profiler)
3. Profile memory with heap dumps and allocation tracking
4. Profile I/O with strace/perf trace for syscall analysis
5. Profile latency with distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
6. Identify bottleneck, formulate hypothesis, implement fix
7. Re-profile to verify improvement, repeat

## Security Considerations

### Threat Modeling (STRIDE)
- Spoofing: Identity validation, authentication
- Tampering: Integrity checks, digital signatures
- Repudiation: Audit logs, non-repudiation
- Information disclosure: Encryption, access control
- Denial of service: Rate limiting, resource quotas
- Elevation of privilege: Principle of least privilege

### Supply Chain Security
- Dependency scanning: Snyk, Dependabot, Trivy
- SBOM generation: CycloneDX or SPDX format
- Signed commits: GPG or SSH commit signing
- Artifact verification: Checksum validation, signature verification

### Secrets Management
- Secrets never in code — always in secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Rotation policy: Rotate database credentials every 90 days
- Access audit: Log every secrets access, alert on anomalies
- Encryption at rest and in transit for all secrets
- Principle of least privilege: each service gets only its own secrets

## Rules
- Default-deny security posture — allow only explicitly required access.
- All inputs validated, all outputs encoded, all errors handled.
- Defend in depth — multiple layers of security controls.
- Fail securely — errors default to safe behavior.
- Log security-relevant events for audit and investigation.
- Keep dependencies updated — automate vulnerability scanning.
- Design for observability from day one, not as an afterthought.
- Document all architectural decisions with rationale.
- Review code for security, performance, and correctness before merging.
## Architecture Decision Trees

### Acceptance Test Approach
| Decision Point | Option A | Option B | Decision Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Specification format | Gherkin (BDD, business-readable) | Code-only (developer-maintained) | Stakeholder involvement, team skill mix |
| Test scope | Happy path only (fast feedback) | Full scenario matrix (comprehensive) | Timeline, risk profile, compliance needs |
| Automation level | Fully automated (CI-gated) | Semi-automated (UAT manual) | Regulatory requirements, UI volatility |
| Environment | Dedicated staging env (isolated) | Production-like (mock external) | Cost, external dependency reliability |

### Test Scenario Prioritization
- P0 → Core business flows, revenue-critical paths. Must pass before release.
- P1 → Important workflows, high-impact non-critical. Failures need documented exceptions.
- P2 → Edge cases, low-traffic features. Tested when time permits.
