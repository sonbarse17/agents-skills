# Code Organization

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Code Organization**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket and leaky bucket algorithms to prevent API abuse and manage quotas.
- **Bloom Filters**: Probabilistic data structures used to rapidly verify if an element definitely does not exist.
- **CQRS Pattern**: Segregating write models (Commands) from read models (Queries) for independent scaling.
- **Raft Consensus**: Leader election and log replication algorithm designed for understandability over Paxos.

### Core Implementation

```python
def get_consistent_hash_node(key, nodes, virtual_nodes=100):
    ring = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for i in range(virtual_nodes):
            hash_val = hash(f"{node}:{i}")
            ring[hash_val] = node
    
    key_hash = hash(key)
    for h in sorted(ring.keys()):
        if h >= key_hash:
            return ring[h]
    return ring[min(ring.keys())]
```

## 2. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Code Organization**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Consistent Hashing**: Maps data to nodes using a hash ring, minimizing key redistribution when nodes scale.
- **Distributed Caching**: Utilizing Redis/Memcached to absorb read-heavy traffic and reduce latency.
- **Database Sharding**: Horizontally partitioning data across nodes using a routing key to bypass vertical scaling limits.
- **Vector Clocks**: Logical clocks used to determine the partial ordering of events in distributed systems.

### Mathematical Thresholds
$$ \text{Replication Factor} = N \implies \text{Quorum Write } (W) + \text{Quorum Read } (R) > N $$
