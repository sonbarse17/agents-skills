# Architecture Patterns

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Architecture Patterns**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket and leaky bucket algorithms to prevent API abuse and manage quotas.
- **Database Sharding**: Horizontally partitioning data across nodes using a routing key to bypass vertical scaling limits.
- **Raft Consensus**: Leader election and log replication algorithm designed for understandability over Paxos.
- **PACELC Theorem**: An extension of CAP; even without partitions, trade-offs between Latency and Consistency exist.
- **Distributed Caching**: Utilizing Redis/Memcached to absorb read-heavy traffic and reduce latency.

### Core Implementation

```python
def get_consistent_hash_node(key, nodes, virtual_nodes=100):
    ring = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for i in range(virtual_nodes):
            hash_val = hash(f"{node}:{i}")
            ring[hash_val] = node
    
    key_hash = hash(key)
    for h in sorted(ring.keys()):
        if h >= key_hash:
            return ring[h]
    return ring[min(ring.keys())]
```

## 2. Advanced Strategy and Execution

### Mathematical Thresholds
$$ \text{Availability} = \frac{\text{MTBF}}{\text{MTBF} + \text{MTTR}} $$

## 3. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Architecture Patterns**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Read-Heavy vs Write-Heavy**: Designing tailored indexes, materialized views, and LSM trees based on access patterns.
- **Consistent Hashing**: Maps data to nodes using a hash ring, minimizing key redistribution when nodes scale.
- **CAP Theorem**: Systems must trade off between Consistency and Availability during network partitions.

        try {
            Response res = action.get();
            failures.set(0); // Reset on success
            return res;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            failures.incrementAndGet();
            throw e;
        }
