# Skill

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Skill**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Distributed Caching**: Utilizing Redis/Memcached to absorb read-heavy traffic and reduce latency.
- **Event Sourcing**: Storing the state of an application as a sequence of immutable events.
- **Gossip Protocol**: Decentralized node communication ensuring eventual cluster awareness.
- **Database Sharding**: Horizontally partitioning data across nodes using a routing key to bypass vertical scaling limits.

### Core Implementation

```python
def get_consistent_hash_node(key, nodes, virtual_nodes=100):
    ring = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for i in range(virtual_nodes):
            hash_val = hash(f"{node}:{i}")
            ring[hash_val] = node
    
    key_hash = hash(key)
    for h in sorted(ring.keys()):
        if h >= key_hash:
            return ring[h]
    return ring[min(ring.keys())]
```

        try {
            Response res = action.get();
            failures.set(0); // Reset on success
            return res;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            failures.incrementAndGet();
            throw e;
