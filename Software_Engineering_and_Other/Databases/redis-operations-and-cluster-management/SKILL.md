# Redis Operations and Cluster Management

## Purpose

Redis is an in-memory data store first — every operational decision
(persistence mode, cluster topology, memory limits) is really a decision
about what happens when a process restarts, a node dies, or memory fills
up, since none of those are free consequences of "just using Redis" the
way they might be with a disk-native database. This skill covers the
operational core: persistence (RDB snapshots vs. AOF append-only
logging, and running both together), Redis Cluster's hash-slot sharding
and failover mechanics, Sentinel as the alternative HA mechanism for
non-clustered deployments, and memory management under `maxmemory` and
eviction policies. It is deliberately scoped to infrastructure/topology
operations — for validating a proposed `maxmemory`/eviction/cluster
config before it's relied on in production, see
[redis-configuration-validation](../[redis-configuration-validation](../redis-configuration-validation/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md);
for the application-facing question of *how* to use Redis as a cache
(cache-aside vs. write-through, TTL strategy, invalidation), see
[redis-caching-strategy-and-invalidation-patterns](../[redis-caching-strategy-and-invalidation-patterns](../redis-caching-strategy-and-invalidation-patterns/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md),
which is a distinct concern from the cluster/persistence mechanics here.

## When to use

- Standing up or troubleshooting Redis Cluster: hash slot assignment,
  adding/removing shards, resharding, or a cluster stuck in a `fail`
  state.
- Choosing or troubleshooting persistence: deciding between RDB-only,
  AOF-only, or both, or diagnosing data loss after a restart/crash that
  shouldn't have happened given the configured persistence.
- A replica failed to take over automatically after a primary died (in
  Cluster mode or with Sentinel), or failover took much longer than
  expected.
- Redis is evicting keys or returning `OOM command not allowed` errors,
  and the cause isn't obvious from `maxmemory` alone.
- Planning [capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/Cloud_Providers/azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md): sizing `maxmemory` per node, deciding shard count
  for a cluster, or estimating memory overhead of a specific data
  structure choice at scale.
- Rebalancing an unevenly-loaded cluster (a hot shard, uneven hash slot
  distribution) or migrating slots off a node being decommissioned.

## Prerequisites & environment

- Redis 6.2+ assumed for the guidance and command syntax below;
  Redis Cluster's core hash-slot mechanics have been stable since
  Cluster's introduction in Redis 3.0, but ACL-related cluster commands
  and some `CLUSTER` subcommand output shapes assume 6+. Call out
  explicitly where a feature needs a specific newer version (e.g.
  `CLUSTER SHARDS` replacing the older `CLUSTER SLOTS` output shape is
  7.0+).
- For Cluster mode: a minimum of 3 primary nodes (Redis Cluster requires
  at least 3 primaries to form a cluster and reach quorum on slot
  ownership), each ideally with at least one replica for automatic
  failover — a 3-primary, 0-replica cluster survives no primary failure
  without manual intervention.
- For Sentinel-based HA (non-clustered, single-primary-with-replicas
  topology): a minimum of 3 Sentinel processes across independent
  failure domains, since Sentinel's own failover decision requires a
  quorum vote among Sentinels, not just one Sentinel's opinion.
- `redis-cli` and (for cluster operations) `redis-cli --cluster` support
  compiled in, or the standalone `redis-trib.rb` on older (pre-5.0)
  versions where the cluster helper wasn't yet folded into `redis-cli`.
- Enough disk space on each node for RDB snapshots and/or the AOF file
  (plus headroom during `BGREWRITEAOF`, which briefly holds both old and
  new AOF content) — sized independently from the `maxmemory` RAM
  budget.

## Step-by-step guidance

### 1. Choose a persistence strategy deliberately, not by default

Redis offers two independent, combinable mechanisms:
- **RDB** — point-in-time binary snapshots, taken on a schedule
  (`save 900 1` etc.) or on demand (`BGSAVE`). Fast to load on restart,
  compact on disk, but loses everything since the last snapshot on a
  crash.
- **AOF** — an append-only log of write commands, replayed on restart.
  Configurable durability via `appendfsync`:
  ```
  appendonly yes
  appendfsync everysec   # fsync once per second — default, small (~1s) loss window
  # appendfsync always   # fsync every write — near-zero loss, materially slower
  # appendfsync no       # let the OS decide — fastest, largest loss window
  ```
  `everysec` is the right default for most workloads: `always` adds
  meaningful per-write latency for a durability gain most workloads
  don't need, and `no` reintroduces most of RDB's loss-window risk while
  giving up RDB's compactness.

Running both (`appendonly yes` plus scheduled RDB) is the common
production choice: AOF for a small loss window on restart, RDB for fast
full-cluster bootstrap and for portable backups (RDB files are a single
compact file, easy to ship off-box; AOF files can be large and slower to
replay on cold start). Redis prefers the AOF for recovery when both are
present and `appendonly yes`, since it's more current.

### 2. Manage AOF growth with rewrite, and understand what triggers it

The AOF file grows forever without rewriting — periodically Redis
compacts it into the minimal set of commands that reproduce the current
dataset:
```
auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100   # rewrite when AOF is 2x the size after last rewrite
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb    # don't rewrite tiny files at startup
```
```bash
redis-cli BGREWRITEAOF
```
A rewrite forks the process (same COW mechanics as `BGSAVE`) — on a
host with little free memory margin, a fork on a large dataset can fail
or cause a latency spike as the kernel sets up copy-on-write page
tables. Size hosts with real headroom above `maxmemory` (a common
starting rule of thumb is roughly 1.5x `maxmemory` free, though the
actual requirement scales with write rate during the fork, not a fixed
ratio) rather than running right up to the memory ceiling.

### 3. Understand Redis Cluster's hash slot model before resharding anything

Redis Cluster splits the keyspace into 16384 hash slots, each owned by
exactly one primary at a time:
```bash
redis-cli -c CLUSTER SHARDS
redis-cli -c CLUSTER SLOTS       # older/wider-compatible form
```
A key's slot is `CRC16(key) mod 16384`, or the slot of the substring
inside `{}` if the key contains a hash tag (e.g. `user:{1000}:profile`
and `user:{1000}:orders` hash to the same slot, enabling multi-key
operations across them) — a design decision that must be made when
choosing key naming conventions, not retrofitted later, since existing
keys don't get hash tags added automatically.

### 4. Reshard deliberately, with [monitoring](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md), never as a blind migration

```bash
redis-cli --cluster reshard <any-node>:6379 \
  --cluster-from <source-node-id> \
  --cluster-to <dest-node-id> \
  --cluster-slots 1000 \
  --cluster-yes
```
Resharding moves slots (and the keys in them) live, slot-range by
slot-range, migrating keys one at a time via `MIGRATE` under the hood —
clients see a brief `ASK`/`MOVED` redirect for keys mid-transfer rather
than an outage, provided client libraries handle cluster redirects
correctly (most modern cluster-aware clients do this transparently).
Reshard in a maintenance window for large slot ranges regardless, since
`MIGRATE` for very large keys (a huge hash or sorted set) can add
latency during that specific key's move, and monitor
`redis-cli --cluster check <any-node>:6379` afterward to confirm no
slot is left in a transitional/inconsistent state.

### 5. Configure replica-based failover and verify it actually completes

In Cluster mode, each primary should have at least one replica; Redis
Cluster's own failure detection (gossip-based, via `CLUSTER NODES`
health state) promotes a replica automatically once enough other
primaries mark the failed primary `PFAIL`/`FAIL`:
```bash
redis-cli -c CLUSTER NODES | grep master
```
For non-clustered HA, Sentinel monitors a primary/replica set and
performs the promotion:
```
# sentinel.conf
sentinel monitor mymaster <PRIMARY_HOST> 6379 2   # quorum = 2 of N sentinels must agree
sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 5000
sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 60000
```
The quorum value (`2` above) is the number of Sentinels that must agree
the primary is down before a failover is *initiated* — it is not the
number needed to *elect the Sentinel leader* that carries it out, which
requires a majority of all configured Sentinels regardless of the
monitor quorum setting. Run an odd number of Sentinels (3 or 5) across
independent failure domains for the same reason a consensus store needs
odd-numbered quorum in any leader-election design.

### 6. Size `maxmemory` and choose an eviction policy that matches data classification

```
maxmemory 8gb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```
- `noeviction` (the default if unset): writes fail with `OOM command
  not allowed` once memory is full — correct for data that must never be
  silently dropped (e.g. Redis used as a primary datastore, a queue), but
  it will surface as application write errors, not graceful degradation.
- `allkeys-lru` / `allkeys-lfu`: evict any key regardless of whether it
  has a TTL, approximating least-recently/frequently-used — appropriate
  for a pure cache where every key is disposable.
- `volatile-lru` / `volatile-lfu` / `volatile-ttl`: only evict keys that
  have a TTL set, leaving keys with no TTL untouched even under memory
  pressure — useful when Redis holds a mix of cache data (with TTLs) and
  data that must persist (no TTL), but dangerous if application code
  assumes *all* data is safe from eviction just because some of it is.
Mismatching policy to actual data classification is one of the most
common production incidents with Redis — see the pitfalls below.

### 7. Monitor real memory fragmentation, not just used memory against maxmemory

```bash
redis-cli INFO memory | grep -E "used_memory:|used_memory_rss:|mem_fragmentation_ratio"
```
`mem_fragmentation_ratio` well above 1.0 (rule of thumb: above ~1.5)
indicates the OS-level RSS is significantly larger than Redis's own
accounting of `used_memory`, usually from allocator fragmentation after
heavy key churn with varying value sizes. This headroom is *not*
visible in `maxmemory` accounting (which tracks `used_memory`, not RSS)
and can still trigger an OS-level OOM kill even though Redis believes
it's under its configured limit. `MEMORY PURGE` (where supported by the
allocator, e.g. jemalloc) or a planned restart/failover to a fresh
replica can reclaim fragmented memory; investigate before assuming a
`maxmemory` increase alone fixes a fragmentation problem, since it
often doesn't.

## Best practices

- Run both RDB and AOF in production for anything beyond a pure,
  fully-disposable cache — RDB for fast full recovery and portable
  backups, AOF (`appendfsync everysec`) for a small restart-loss window.
- Give hosts genuine free-memory headroom above `maxmemory` for
  `BGSAVE`/`BGREWRITEAOF` fork operations — don't size to the RAM ceiling
  with no margin for copy-on-write growth during a fork.
- Always run at least one replica per primary shard in Cluster mode (or
  a 3+ Sentinel quorum for non-clustered HA) — a cluster with zero
  replicas has no automatic failover path at all, only manual
  intervention after data loss on that shard.
- Choose `maxmemory-policy` based on actual data classification per
  logical use, not a single fleet-wide default — a shared Redis instance
  mixing cache and non-disposable data needs `volatile-*` with disposable
  data explicitly TTL'd, verified, not assumed.
- Bake hash-tag conventions (`{}`) into key naming from day one for any
  application that will eventually need multi-key transactions or
  Lua scripts spanning related keys in a clustered deployment — adding
  hash tags retroactively means re-keying existing data.
- Monitor `mem_fragmentation_ratio` and replication lag
  (`master_repl_offset` vs. replica's `slave_repl_offset`) as standing
  health metrics, not just `used_memory` against `maxmemory`.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** Application writes intermittently fail with
  `OOM command not allowed when used memory > 'maxmemory'`, even though
  the workload is a cache and eviction was assumed to be handling this.
  **Fix:** `maxmemory-policy` is set to (or defaulted to) `noeviction`.
  Confirm the intended policy with `CONFIG GET maxmemory-policy` and set
  an eviction policy that matches the data (`allkeys-lru` for a pure
  cache) rather than assuming eviction is on by default — `noeviction`
  is Redis's actual default.

- **Symptom:** Keys that the application assumed were safe from eviction
  (no TTL set) are missing after a period of memory pressure.
  **Fix:** `maxmemory-policy` is set to `allkeys-lru`/`allkeys-lfu`,
  which evicts *any* key regardless of TTL. If some keys must survive
  eviction, switch to a `volatile-*` policy and confirm every key that
  must persist genuinely has no TTL set (a bug that sets an accidental
  TTL on non-cache data under `volatile-*` is just as dangerous as the
  wrong policy).

- **Symptom:** A primary node crashes in Cluster mode and the cluster
  stays in a `FAIL`/degraded state instead of promoting a replica.
  **Fix:** That shard has zero replicas configured, or its replica is
  also unreachable (e.g. colocated with the primary on the same failed
  host/AZ). Verify replica placement is genuinely spread across failure
  domains (`CLUSTER NODES` showing replica host != primary host, ideally
  different AZ/rack) and that every shard has at least one healthy
  replica before treating the cluster as production-ready.

- **Symptom:** Redis's process RSS memory (as seen by the OS / `top`)
  is much higher than `used_memory` reported by `INFO memory`, and the
  host eventually hits an OS-level OOM kill despite `maxmemory` never
  being exceeded from Redis's own perspective.
  **Fix:** This is allocator fragmentation (`mem_fragmentation_ratio`
  significantly above 1), not a `maxmemory` misconfiguration — `maxmemory`
  only bounds `used_memory`, not RSS. Investigate key churn patterns
  causing fragmentation, try `MEMORY PURGE` on a jemalloc-backed build,
  or plan a rolling restart/failover to defragment, and size host RAM
  with fragmentation headroom beyond `maxmemory`, not exactly at it.

- **Symptom:** Someone runs `FLUSHALL` against what turns out to be the
  production cluster (intending a staging/test instance), wiping every
  key with no confirmation prompt and no way to undo it.
  **Fix:** `FLUSHALL`/`FLUSHDB` are immediate, irreversible, cluster-wide
  (in `FLUSHALL`'s case) destructive operations with no built-in
  confirmation step.
  > **Warning — destructive action.** Never run `FLUSHALL`/`FLUSHDB`
  > against a shared or production endpoint without independently
  > confirming the target host/cluster via `CLUSTER INFO` or a
  > connection-string review, and restrict the command via Redis ACLs
  > (`-@dangerous` category, or explicitly denying `flushall`/`flushdb`)
  > for any role/credential that doesn't specifically need it, so a
  > mistaken connection to production can't execute it at all.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** A session-store Redis deployment (currently a single
primary + 1 replica with Sentinel) needs to move to a 3-shard Redis
Cluster ahead of an expected 4x traffic increase, and persistence needs
review since a prior [incident](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) lost 30 minutes of session data on an
unplanned restart.

1. Review current persistence: RDB-only, `save 3600 1` (hourly
   snapshot) — this is why 30 minutes of writes were lost on restart, a
   30-minute window is far larger than the [incident](../../../DevOps_and_Cloud/Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md)'s actual tolerance.
   Enable AOF alongside the existing RDB schedule:
   ```
   appendonly yes
   appendfsync everysec
   ```
2. Provision 3 primaries + 3 replicas (one replica per primary, each
   replica placed in a different AZ than its primary) and initialize
   the cluster:
   ```bash
   redis-cli --cluster create \
     <node1>:6379 <node2>:6379 <node3>:6379 \
     <node4>:6379 <node5>:6379 <node6>:6379 \
     --cluster-replicas 1
   ```
3. Adopt a hash-tag key convention ahead of migration so multi-key
   session operations (e.g. a session plus its associated rate-limit
   counter) land on the same slot:
   `session:{<session_id>}:data`, `session:{<session_id>}:ratelimit`.
4. Migrate existing single-primary data into the cluster via
   application-level dual-write during a cutover window, then verify
   via `redis-cli --cluster check` that all 16384 slots are covered with
   no gaps before cutting reads over.
5. Set `maxmemory-policy volatile-lru` (sessions carry a TTL; nothing
   else is stored on this instance) and size `maxmemory` per node with
   ~40% headroom over steady-state `used_memory` for `BGREWRITEAOF` fork
   safety during the 4x traffic ramp.
6. Post-migration, monitor `CLUSTER NODES` for replica health and
   `mem_fragmentation_ratio` weekly; the old Sentinel-based pair is
   decommissioned only after a full week of clean cluster operation
   under real production traffic.
