# Skill

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Skill**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Event Sourcing**: Storing the state of an application as a sequence of immutable events.
- **Consistent Hashing**: Maps data to nodes using a hash ring, minimizing key redistribution when nodes scale.
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket and leaky bucket algorithms to prevent API abuse and manage quotas.

### Core Implementation

```java
public class CircuitBreaker {
    private AtomicInteger failures = new AtomicInteger(0);
    private final int threshold = 5;
    
    public Response execute(Supplier<Response> action) {
        if (failures.get() >= threshold) throw new CircuitOpenException();
        try {
            Response res = action.get();
            failures.set(0); // Reset on success
            return res;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            failures.incrementAndGet();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Skill**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Database Sharding**: Horizontally partitioning data across nodes using a routing key to bypass vertical scaling limits.
- **CQRS Pattern**: Segregating write models (Commands) from read models (Queries) for independent scaling.
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket and leaky bucket algorithms to prevent API abuse and manage quotas.

### Mathematical Thresholds
$$ \text{Replication Factor} = N \implies \text{Quorum Write } (W) + \text{Quorum Read } (R) > N $$

## 3. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Skill**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Bloom Filters**: Probabilistic data structures used to rapidly verify if an element definitely does not exist.
- **Read-Heavy vs Write-Heavy**: Designing tailored indexes, materialized views, and LSM trees based on access patterns.

## 5. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Skill**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Consistent Hashing**: Maps data to nodes using a hash ring, minimizing key redistribution when nodes scale.
- **PACELC Theorem**: An extension of CAP; even without partitions, trade-offs between Latency and Consistency exist.
- **CAP Theorem**: Systems must trade off between Consistency and Availability during network partitions.
- **Saga Pattern**: Managing distributed transactions through a sequence of local transactions and compensating actions.
- **Bloom Filters**: Probabilistic data structures used to rapidly verify if an element definitely does not exist.

### Core Implementation

```python
def get_consistent_hash_node(key, nodes, virtual_nodes=100):
    ring = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for i in range(virtual_nodes):
            hash_val = hash(f"{node}:{i}")
            ring[hash_val] = node
    
    key_hash = hash(key)
    for h in sorted(ring.keys()):
        if h >= key_hash:
            return ring[h]
    return ring[min(ring.keys())]
```
