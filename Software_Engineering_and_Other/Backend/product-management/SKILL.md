# API Product Management

## Purpose
Manage APIs as products: define API product strategy, design developer experience, manage API lifecycle, implement API monetization, build developer portals that drive adoption, and use API analytics to inform product decisions.

## Workflow

### API Product Lifecycle
```
Strategy → Design → Build → Publish → Promote → Monitor → Iterate
                                                          ↓
                                                    Deprecate → Retire
```

### API Product Strategy Framework

#### Vision & Mission
```
API Product Vision:
  "Our API platform enables any developer to integrate payments
   in under 5 minutes, driving ecosystem growth and partner revenue."

API Product Mission:
  "Provide the most developer-friendly payment processing API
   with 99.99% uptime, comprehensive SDKs, and transparent pricing."
```

#### Strategy Canvas
| Dimension | Current State | Target State | Gap |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| Developer adoption | 500 active consumers | 5000 active consumers | Documentation, SDKs |
| API reliability | 99.9% uptime | 99.99% uptime | Multi-region, redundancy |
| Feature coverage | Payments only | Payments + Subscriptions + Payouts | Roadmap |
| Developer experience | 15 min to first call | 3 min to first call | Quickstart, SDKs |
| Monetization | Free only | Free + Pro + Enterprise | Pricing tiers |

#### API Business Models

| Model | Description | Example | Best For |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Free | No charge, drive ecosystem adoption | GitHub API | Platform lock-in, ecosystem growth |
| Usage-based | Pay per request/unit | Stripe ($0.025/call) | Variable usage patterns |
| Tiered | Different plans with limits | Google Maps API | Predictable consumption segments |
| Freemium | Free tier + paid premium | Slack API | Bottom-up adoption |
| Revenue share | % of transaction value | Stripe Connect (2.9% + $0.30) | Platform businesses |
| Internal value | Cost savings, not direct revenue | Platform APIs | Internal developer platforms |

#### Selecting the Right Model
```yaml
model_selection_factors:
  - consumer_type: [developer, enterprise, partner]
  - usage_pattern: [steady, bursty, growing]
  - value_metric: [requests, data_volume, transactions, users]
  - market_position: [new_entrant, challenger, market_leader]

example:
  scenario: SaaS platform launching public API
  recommendation:
    primary: freemium
    tiers:
      - name: Free
        limits: 1000 req/day, read-only
        goal: Developer onboarding
      - name: Pro
        limits: 100000 req/day, read-write
        price: $99/month
        goal: Revenue from growing apps
      - name: Enterprise
        limits: Custom, SLA-backed
        price: Custom
        goal: Strategic partnerships
```

### API Maturity Model

| Level | Name | Characteristics | Capabilities |
|-------|------|----------------|--------------|
| 0 | No API | Direct DB access, no abstraction | — |
| 1 | Internal | Private APIs, single consumer | Basic endpoints |
| 2 | Partner | Published API docs, partner onboarding | API keys, docs portal |
| 3 | Ecosystem | Public API portal, self-service | Self-serve signup, SDKs, SLAs |
| 4 | Platform | API marketplace, monetization | Pricing tiers, usage analytics |
| 5 | API-first | APIs drive product strategy, internal + external | API design reviews, dogfooding, API-as-product |

### API Versioning Strategy

#### Versioning Approaches

| Strategy | Mechanism | Example | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-----------|---------|------|------|
| URL path | Path prefix | `/v1/users` | Explicit, cacheable | URL duplication |
| Header | Accept header | `Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=2` | Clean URLs | Harder to discover |
| Query param | Query string | `/users?api-version=2024-01-01` | Easy to test | Pollutes URLs, not cacheable |
| Content negotiation | Content-Type | `Content-Type: application/vnd.example.v2+json` | Semantic | Complex |
| No versioning | Backward-compatible only | `/users` | Simplest | Breaking changes break all |

#### Version Lifecycle Policy
```yaml
version_policy:
  naming: semver                    # v{major}.{minor}.{patch}
  current_version: v3
  supported_versions:
    - version: v1
      status: sunset
      sunset_date: "2025-12-31"
      active_consumers: 2
    - version: v2
      status: deprecated
      sunset_date: "2026-06-30"
      active_consumers: 45
    - version: v3
      status: current
      sunset_date: null
      active_consumers: 230
    - version: v4
      status: beta
      sunset_date: null
      active_consumers: 12

  rules:
    max_supported_versions: 2       # Only 2 active versions at any time
    deprecation_notice_days: 180    # Minimum 6 months notice
    sunset_after_deprecation_days: 90
    beta_lifetime_days: 90
```

### Deprecation & Sunset Policy

#### Deprecation Process
```
Week 1:  Announce deprecation with timeline
Week 2:  Add Deprecation + Sunset headers to API responses
Week 4:  Email all known consumers with migration guide
Week 8:  Schedule migration office hours
Month 6: Deprecated version enters sunset
Month 7: Traffic cutoff — return 410 Gone
Month 8: Infrastructure decommissioned
```

#### Deprecation Headers
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Deprecation: true
Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT
Link: </docs/migrate-v2-to-v3>; rel="deprecation"
```

#### Breaking Change Classification

| Change Type | Breaking? | Recommended Approach |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Remove a field | Yes | Deprecate field, keep 6+ months, then remove in new version |
| Rename a field | Yes | Add new field, deprecate old, migrate consumers |
| Change field type | Yes | New field with new type, deprecate old |
| Add required field | Yes | Make optional with default value |
| Remove an endpoint | Yes | Return 301 redirect or deprecate with sunset header |
| Change error codes | Yes | Add new codes, preserve old codes during migration |
| Change auth method | Yes | Support both old and new during migration window |
| Add optional field | No | Safe additive change — no impact on existing consumers |
| Add new endpoint | No | No impact on existing consumers |
| Relax validation | No | Old inputs remain valid |
| Change response format | Yes (if clients parse structure) | New version or careful additive changes |

### Developer Experience (DX)

#### DX Hierarchy
```
1. Discoverable  — Developers find what they need without external docs
2. Consistent   — Same patterns across all endpoints
3. Predictable  — Responses match expectations
4. Forgiving    — Sensible defaults, helpful errors
5. Performant   — Fast responses, efficient payloads
```

#### First Call Experience
```bash
# Copy-paste ready — first API call in under 2 minutes
export API_KEY="your_key_here"

curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
     https://api.example.com/v3/users \
     | jq '.'
```

```python
# Python quickstart
import os
from example_api_client import ApiClient

client = ApiClient(api_key=os.environ["API_KEY"])
users = client.users.list(limit=5)
for user in users:
    print(f"{user.name} ({user.email})")
```

#### SDK Design Principles
```typescript
// Intuitive client — follows natural language patterns
const client = new ApiClient({ apiKey: "sk-..." });

// Resource methods instead of generic request()
const user = await client.users.get("usr_123");
const users = await client.users.list({ page: 1, perPage: 50 });
const newUser = await client.users.create({ name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" });

// Typed responses
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: string;
}

// Typed errors
try {
  await client.users.get("invalid");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ApiError) {
    console.log(`[${error.status}] ${error.body.detail}`);
  }
}
```

### API Monetization

#### Usage Tracking Architecture
```python
class UsageTracker:
    def record(self, api_key: str, endpoint: str, method: str, status: int, latency_ms: int):
        event = {
            "api_key_hash": hashlib.sha256(api_key.encode()).hexdigest(),
            "endpoint": endpoint,
            "method": method,
            "status": status,
            "latency_ms": latency_ms,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "tier": self.get_tier(api_key),
        }
        self.buffer.append(event)
        if len(self.buffer) >= 100:
            self.flush()

    def check_limits(self, api_key: str) -> dict:
        tier = self.get_tier(api_key)
        usage = self.get_current_usage(api_key)
        limits = self.get_tier_limits(tier)

        return {
            "allowed": usage["requests"] < limits["max_requests"],
            "current": usage["requests"],
            "limit": limits["max_requests"],
            "reset_at": usage["window_end"],
            "remaining": limits["max_requests"] - usage["requests"],
        }
```

#### Tier Configuration
```yaml
tiers:
  free:
    requests_per_second: 10
    requests_per_day: 1000
    max_concurrent: 5
    features: [read]
    support: community
    sla_uptime: "99.9%"

  pro:
    requests_per_second: 100
    requests_per_day: 100000
    max_concurrent: 50
    features: [read, write, webhooks]
    support: email
    sla_uptime: "99.95%"
    price: "$99/month"

  enterprise:
    requests_per_second: 1000
    requests_per_day: unlimited
    max_concurrent: 500
    features: [read, write, webhooks, admin, audit_logs]
    support: dedicated
    sla_uptime: "99.99%"
    price: "Custom"
```

#### Analytics Dashboard SQL
```sql
-- Active consumers per version
SELECT
    api_version,
    COUNT(DISTINCT api_key_hash) as active_consumers,
    COUNT(*) as total_requests,
    AVG(latency_ms) as avg_latency,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status >= 500 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as error_rate
FROM api_usage
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY api_version
ORDER BY api_version;

-- Churned consumers (active in previous month, inactive this month)
SELECT DISTINCT api_key_hash
FROM api_usage
WHERE timestamp BETWEEN NOW() - INTERVAL '60 days' AND NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND api_key_hash NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT api_key_hash
    FROM api_usage
    WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  );
```

#### API Product Scorecard
```python
class ApiProductScorecard:
    def compute(self, metrics: dict) -> dict:
        weights = {
            "adoption": 0.25,
            "developer_experience": 0.25,
            "reliability": 0.25,
            "business_value": 0.15,
            "documentation": 0.10,
        }
        scores = {
            "adoption": self.adoption_score(metrics),
            "developer_experience": self.dx_score(metrics),
            "reliability": self.reliability_score(metrics),
            "business_value": self.business_score(metrics),
            "documentation": self.docs_score(metrics),
        }
        total = sum(scores[k] * weights[k] for k in scores)
        return {
            "overall": round(total, 1),
            "breakdown": scores,
            "status": "healthy" if total >= 80 else "needs_attention" if total >= 60 else "critical",
        }
```

### API Governance

#### Design Review Gates
```yaml
api_design_review:
  required_for:
    - New endpoint creation
    - Breaking schema changes
    - New authentication mechanisms
    - Error format changes

  checklist:
    - [ ] Naming follows API style guide (snake_case, plural resources)
    - [ ] Pagination implemented for list endpoints
    - [ ] Error responses follow RFC 7807 format
    - [ ] Rate limiting documented
    - [ ] Authentication method specified
    - [ ] OpenAPI spec updated
    - [ ] Changelog entry drafted
    - [ ] Migration guide written (if breaking)

  review_process:
    - Submit RFC via API governance repository
    - 3 business days for review
    - Two approvals required from API council
    - Design review blocks production deployment
```

#### API Catalog
```yaml
api_catalog:
  - name: Users API
    version: v3
    status: current
    owner: team-identity
    endpoints: 12
    consumers: 230
    p99_latency: 150ms
    error_rate: 0.2%
    documentation_url: /docs/users
    sdk_coverage: [python, typescript, go, java]

  - name: Payments API
    version: v2
    status: deprecated
    owner: team-payments
    endpoints: 8
    consumers: 45
    p99_latency: 280ms
    error_rate: 0.5%
    sunset_date: "2026-06-30"
    migration_guide: /docs/migrate-payments-v2-to-v3
```

### Stakeholder Communication

#### API Product Health Report (Monthly)
```markdown
## API Platform Health — June 2026

### Highlights
- 12% MoM growth in active consumers (now 1,200)
- v3 API reaches 99.95% uptime (above 99.9% SLO)
- New TypeScript SDK published — 40% adoption in first month

### Version Migration Status
| Version | Status | Consumers | Actions Required |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| v1 | Sunsetting — Dec 2025 | 2 | Urgent: migrate to v3 |
| v2 | Deprecated — June 2026 | 45 | Planned: migrate to v3 |
| v3 | Current | 230 | — |
| v4 | Beta | 12 | — |

### Risk Items
- 2 remaining v1 consumers at risk of cutoff
- Payments API P99 latency increased 30% (investigating)
- 3 open P1 support tickets from enterprise consumers

## Stakeholder Alignment Techniques

### One-on-One Preparation
Before roadmap reviews or major decisions:
```yaml
pre_meeting_prep:
  for_each_stakeholder:
    - What are their top 3 priorities this quarter?
    - How does the proposal support or conflict with those priorities?
    - What objections might they raise?
    - What data would address those objections?
    - Who are potential allies who could support the proposal?

  expected_pushback:
    - VP Product: "This delays revenue-generating features"
      response: "Show adoption impact data, expected revenue from improved DX"
    - Engineering Director: "We don't have capacity"
      response: "Trade-off analysis: what we'd descope to make room"
    - Sales: "Customers are asking for this feature"
      response: "Track feature request volume, show prioritization score"
```

### Trade-Off Communication
```yaml
trade_off_format:
  decision: "Invest 3 engineers for 6 months in multi-region deployment"

  gains:
    - "99.99% uptime (meets enterprise SLA requirement)"
    - "EU region compliance for GDPR"
    - "P99 latency reduction: 500ms → 100ms"

  costs:
    - "Developer portal v2 delayed to Q3"
    - "Python SDK improvements deferred to Q3"
    - "Mobile SDKs (iOS/Android) deferred to Q1 2027"

  risk:
    - "No remaining capacity for unplanned work"
    - "If timeline slips, no buffer available"
```

### Escalation Framework
| Level | Scope | Resolver | Timeline |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| L1 | Single API/team decision | API Product Manager | 1 week |
| L2 | Cross-team or consumer impact | API Council | 2 weeks |
| L3 | Strategic or pricing changes | VP Product + CTO | 1 month |

## Launch Playbook

### Launch Type Matrix
| Type | Timeline | Effort | Risk | Example |
|------|----------|--------|------|---------|
| New API | 8 weeks | High | High | First version of Payments API |
| Major version | 8 weeks | Medium | Medium | v2→v3 migration |
| Feature add | 4 weeks | Low | Low | New endpoint, sort parameter |
| Beta program | 6 weeks | Medium | Medium | Preview to select partners |

### Launch Day Checklist
```yaml
launch_day_checklist:
  deploy:
    - Deploy to production
    - Verify health check returns 200
    - Execute test queries against production
    - Confirm monitoring data flowing

  communicate:
    - Publish blog post and changelog
    - Announce on community channels (Slack, forum, newsletter)
    - Notify existing partners about new version
    - Social media announcements

  monitor:
    - Check error rate every 15 min for first hour
    - Check P99 latency every 15 min for first hour
    - Monitor support channels for developer questions
    - Watch for unexpected high usage or abuse patterns
```

### Success Metrics by Launch Type
```yaml
new_api_metrics:
  primary:
    - Active developers (MAD) in first 30 days
    - Time to first call (TTFC)
    - Developer NPS from beta participants
  targets:
    ideal: "100+ devs, TTFC < 5 min, NPS > 40"
    acceptable: "50+ devs, TTFC < 10 min, NPS > 30"

major_version_metrics:
  primary:
    - Migration rate (% of consumers on new version)
    - New version adoption in first 90 days
  targets:
    ideal: "80% migrated in 90 days"
    acceptable: "50% migrated in 90 days"

feature_metrics:
  primary:
    - Feature adoption rate (% of consumers using)
    - Feature-specific error rate
  targets:
    ideal: "60% adoption in 30 days, error rate < 0.5%"
    acceptable: "30% adoption in 30 days"
```

## API Monetization Decision Tree

```
Question: What type of API are you launching?
│
├─ Infrastructure/Platform API (compute, storage, messaging)
│   └─ Usage-based pricing (pay per request/unit)
│
├─ Data API (maps, weather, financial data)
│   └─ Tiered pricing by data volume or feature access
│
├─ Transaction API (payments, booking, marketplace)
│   └─ Revenue share (% of transaction value)
│
├─ Platform API (SaaS integrations, embeddable features)
│   ├─ B2B: Per-seat or per-account pricing
│   └─ B2D: Freemium with API call limits
│
└─ Internal Platform API
    └─ Internal value model (cost savings, velocity)
```

### Tier Structure Principles
```yaml
tier_design:
  free_tier:
    purpose: Adoption, familiarity, bottom-up entry
    generosity: Enough for real projects, limited enough to motivate upgrades
    limits: 1,000 requests/day, read-only, community support
    signup_friction: Zero — self-service, instant key

  pro_tier:
    purpose: Revenue from growing applications
    limits: 100,000 requests/day, read-write, webhooks
    price: $99/month or metered
    support: Email, SLA 99.95%

  enterprise_tier:
    purpose: Strategic partnerships, high-value accounts
    limits: Custom, SLA-backed (99.99%), dedicated support
    price: Custom (annual contract)
    features: SSO/SAML, audit logs, dedicated SLAs, custom integrations
```

### Pricing Psychology
- **Anchor high**: Show enterprise tier first to make pro seem reasonable
- **Free tier generosity**: Calculated — enough for real development, not enough for production
- **Usage visibility**: Show consumers their consumption (X-RateLimit-Remaining, dashboard)
- **Automatic upgrades**: Notify when approaching limit, offer seamless upgrade path
- **Annual discounts**: 15-20% discount for annual commitments (improves retention, cash flow)
