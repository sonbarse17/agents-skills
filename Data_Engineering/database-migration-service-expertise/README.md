# DMS Operational Review — AWS DevOps Agent Skill

A comprehensive AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) operational review and troubleshooting skill for [AWS DevOps Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/about-aws-devops-agent.html). Conducts best-practices assessments, health checks, performance diagnostics, cost optimization reviews, and migration cutover guidance.

## What It Does

When activated via Chat, this skill instructs the DevOps Agent to:

1. Discover DMS replication instances, tasks, and endpoints in the configured account/regions.
2. Collect instance configuration, task settings, endpoint connectivity, table statistics, and version data.
3. Collect 7-day historical CloudWatch metrics and task logs.
4. Analyze against 5 assessment categories (Instance Health, Task Health, Endpoint Security, Performance, Cost Efficiency) using a weighted 100-point scoring model.
5. For troubleshooting: classify errors, run targeted diagnostics, and provide root cause analysis.
6. For cutover planning: validate pre-cutover checklist, guide execution, and document rollback procedures.
7. Generate a shareable report artifact per environment, named `dms-review-<instance-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.

## Agent Types

This skill is intended for the following agent types (selected in the Operator Web App at upload time):

- **Chat tasks** — conversational invocation in Chat ("review my DMS environment", "troubleshoot DMS task failure").
- **Evaluation** — proactive operational improvement recommendations.

Select **Generic** instead if you want the skill available to all agent types.

## Prerequisites

### 1. An AWS DevOps Agent Space with the target AWS account

You need an existing [Agent Space](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/getting-started-with-aws-devops-agent-creating-an-agent-space.html) with the target AWS account configured as a cloud source.

### 2. IAM permissions for DMS read access

The Agent Space IAM role needs read-only permissions for DMS resources. Nearly all required actions are already covered by the `AIDevOpsAgentAccessPolicy` managed policy attached to the DevOps Agent role. The one exception is `dms:TestConnection`, which must be granted separately — use the [CloudFormation template](https://github.com/aws/tools-for-devops-agent/blob/main/cloudformation/devops-agent-skill-policies.yaml).

For reference, the complete action set used by this skill:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "dms:Describe*",
        "dms:List*",
        "dms:TestConnection",
        "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
        "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
        "logs:FilterLogEvents",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
        "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
        "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
        "health:DescribeEvents",
        "health:DescribeEventDetails"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. DMS task logging enabled

For troubleshooting and log analysis, DMS tasks must have CloudWatch Logs enabled. Tasks with `EnableLogging: false` will have limited diagnostic capability.

## Uploading to AWS DevOps Agent

> Reference: [Uploading a skill](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/about-aws-devops-agent-devops-agent-skills.html#uploading-a-skill)

### 1. Package the skill

From the `skills/` directory in this repo:

```bash
cd skills
zip -r database-migration-service-expertise.zip database-migration-service-expertise/ -i '*.md' '*.txt' '*.json' '*.yaml' '*.yml' '*.xml' '*.csv' '*.tsv' '*.html' '*.htm' '*.png' '*.jpg' '*.jpeg' '*.gif' '*.svg' '*.webp' '*.pdf' -x '*/.claude/*' '*/scripts/*' '*/README.md' '*/.skilleval.yaml' '*/.skilleval.yml' '*/CHANGELOG.md' '*/evals/*'
```

The resulting `database-migration-service-expertise.zip` contains:

```
database-migration-service-expertise/
├── SKILL.md                    # frontmatter + skill instructions (required)
└── references/
    ├── dms-best-practices.md   # comprehensive best practices reference
    ├── dms-validation-checklist.md  # step-by-step validation criteria
    └── dms-version-reference.md     # version lifecycle and known issues
```

Constraints (enforced at upload time):

- Total zip size ≤ **6 MB**.
- `SKILL.md` is required and must include `name` and `description` frontmatter.
- A `scripts/` directory is **not** allowed — uploads containing scripts are rejected.

### 2. Upload via the Operator Web App

1. Navigate to the **Skills** page in your Agent Space Operator Web App.
2. Click **Add skill** → **Upload skill**.
3. Drag and drop `database-migration-service-expertise.zip` (or browse to it).
4. Select agent types: **Chat tasks** and **Evaluation** (or leave **Generic** to make it available to all agent types).
5. Review the validation results.
6. Click **Upload**.

### 3. (Optional) Connect additional observability sources

For richer analysis, connect your observability tools to the Agent Space:

| Tool | Setup Guide |
|------|-------------|
| CloudWatch | Built-in (no setup needed) |
| Datadog | [Connecting Datadog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/connecting-telemetry-sources-connecting-datadog.html) |
| Dynatrace | [Connecting Dynatrace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/connecting-telemetry-sources-connecting-dynatrace.html) |
| New Relic | [Connecting New Relic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/connecting-telemetry-sources-connecting-new-relic.html) |
| Splunk | [Connecting Splunk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/connecting-telemetry-sources-connecting-splunk.html) |
| Grafana | [Connecting Grafana](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/connecting-telemetry-sources-connecting-grafana.html) |
| Custom MCP | [Connecting MCP Servers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/configuring-capabilities-for-aws-devops-agent-connecting-mcp-servers.html) |

## Usage

In the DevOps Agent Chat, use natural language:

- *"Run a DMS operational review for all instances in us-east-1."*
- *"Review my DMS replication instance `prod-migrator` for best practices."*
- *"Troubleshoot CDC latency on task `oracle-to-aurora-cdc`."*
- *"Assess cost optimization opportunities for my DMS environment."*
- *"Help me plan a migration cutover for task `full-load-cdc-orders`."*
- *"Check DMS version deprecations and recommend upgrades."*

The agent will:

- Collect all data automatically (no prompts for confirmation).
- Cross-reference versions against known issues and deprecation timelines.
- Generate a report artifact per environment, named `dms-review-<instance-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.

## License

⚠️ **This skill is sample code, not intended for production use without additional review and testing.** Users should validate all recommendations in a non-production environment first. Always test DMS configuration changes (version upgrades, task setting modifications, instance resizing) in a staging environment before applying to production migrations.
