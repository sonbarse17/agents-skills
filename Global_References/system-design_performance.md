# Performance

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Performance**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **PACELC Theorem**: An extension of CAP; even without partitions, trade-offs between Latency and Consistency exist.
- **Distributed Caching**: Utilizing Redis/Memcached to absorb read-heavy traffic and reduce latency.
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket and leaky bucket algorithms to prevent API abuse and manage quotas.
- **Vector Clocks**: Logical clocks used to determine the partial ordering of events in distributed systems.

### Core Implementation

```java
public class CircuitBreaker {
    private AtomicInteger failures = new AtomicInteger(0);
    private final int threshold = 5;
    
    public Response execute(Supplier<Response> action) {
        if (failures.get() >= threshold) throw new CircuitOpenException();
        try {
            Response res = action.get();
            failures.set(0); // Reset on success
            return res;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            failures.incrementAndGet();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket and leaky bucket algorithms to prevent API abuse and manage quotas.
- **Consistent Hashing**: Maps data to nodes using a hash ring, minimizing key redistribution when nodes scale.

### Mathematical Thresholds
$$ P(false\_positive) = (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k \text{ for Bloom Filters} $$

            hash_val = hash(f"{node}:{i}")
            ring[hash_val] = node
    
    key_hash = hash(key)
    for h in sorted(ring.keys()):
        if h >= key_hash:
            return ring[h]
    return ring[min(ring.keys())]
