# Performance Optimization

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Performance Optimization**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **CAP Theorem**: Systems must trade off between Consistency and Availability during network partitions.
- **Event Sourcing**: Storing the state of an application as a sequence of immutable events.
- **Raft Consensus**: Leader election and log replication algorithm designed for understandability over Paxos.

### Core Implementation

```python
def get_consistent_hash_node(key, nodes, virtual_nodes=100):
    ring = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for i in range(virtual_nodes):
            hash_val = hash(f"{node}:{i}")
            ring[hash_val] = node
    
    key_hash = hash(key)
    for h in sorted(ring.keys()):
        if h >= key_hash:
            return ring[h]
    return ring[min(ring.keys())]
```

## 2. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Performance Optimization**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **CAP Theorem**: Systems must trade off between Consistency and Availability during network partitions.
- **Idempotency Keys**: Ensuring safe retries in distributed networks by preventing duplicate state mutations.
- **Saga Pattern**: Managing distributed transactions through a sequence of local transactions and compensating actions.
- **Raft Consensus**: Leader election and log replication algorithm designed for understandability over Paxos.
- **PACELC Theorem**: An extension of CAP; even without partitions, trade-offs between Latency and Consistency exist.

### Mathematical Thresholds
$$ \text{Replication Factor} = N \implies \text{Quorum Write } (W) + \text{Quorum Read } (R) > N $$
