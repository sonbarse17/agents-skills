# Performance Optimization

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Performance Optimization**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Gossip Protocol**: Decentralized node communication ensuring eventual cluster awareness.
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket and leaky bucket algorithms to prevent API abuse and manage quotas.
- **PACELC Theorem**: An extension of CAP; even without partitions, trade-offs between Latency and Consistency exist.

### Core Implementation

```java
public class CircuitBreaker {
    private AtomicInteger failures = new AtomicInteger(0);
    private final int threshold = 5;
    
    public Response execute(Supplier<Response> action) {
        if (failures.get() >= threshold) throw new CircuitOpenException();
        try {
            Response res = action.get();
            failures.set(0); // Reset on success
            return res;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            failures.incrementAndGet();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

- **Raft Consensus**: Leader election and log replication algorithm designed for understandability over Paxos.
- **Distributed Caching**: Utilizing Redis/Memcached to absorb read-heavy traffic and reduce latency.
