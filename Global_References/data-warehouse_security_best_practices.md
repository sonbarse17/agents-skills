# Security Best Practices for Data Data Warehouse

## 1. Advanced Strategy and Execution

To optimize **Security Best Practices**, we enforce the following foundational rules:

- **Vectorized Query Engines**: Exploits SIMD instructions for rapid batch data execution.
- **Data Quality Assertions**: Prevents pipeline corruption via schema validation.
- **CAP Theorem Trade-offs**: Balances Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
- **Idempotent Operations**: Guarantees safe retries during distributed pipeline failures.

### Core Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE iceberg_catalog.db.sales (
    id BIGINT,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    event_time TIMESTAMP
) USING iceberg
PARTITIONED BY (days(event_time));
```
