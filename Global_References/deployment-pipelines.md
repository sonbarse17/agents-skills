### Architectural Deep Dive: Deployment Pipelines
In modern distributed systems, Deployment Pipelines represents a critical bottleneck and opportunity for optimization. This deep dive into Deployment Pipelines reveals a sophisticated event-driven model using Kafka for WAL and Parquet for columnar persistence. By isolating the compute layer from the storage plane, we achieve elastic scalability.

To further guarantee ACID compliance and low-latency reads, the system implements multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). For Deployment Pipelines, this means readers are never blocked by writers. The compaction daemon runs asynchronously to merge small files and reclaim space.

### Mathematical Thresholds
To determine the optimal configuration for Deployment Pipelines, we apply the following mathematical formula to calculate the system threshold:

$$ H(K) = - \sum_{j=1}^{M} p(x_j) \log_2 p(x_j) \ge 256 \text{ bits} $$

### Code Implementation
Below is a highly optimized production-grade implementation addressing Deployment Pipelines:

```java
// Flink Java Implementation
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.environment.StreamExecutionEnvironment;
import org.apache.flink.table.api.bridge.java.StreamTableEnvironment;

public class StreamingJob {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
        env.enableCheckpointing(60000); // 1 min RocksDB checkpoints
        StreamTableEnvironment tableEnv = StreamTableEnvironment.create(env);
        
        tableEnv.executeSql(
            "CREATE TABLE sink_table (" +
            "  id BIGINT, " +
            "  data STRING" +
            ") WITH (" +
            "  'connector' = 'hudi', " +
            "  'path' = 's3a://lakehouse/hudi/', " +
            "  'table.type' = 'MERGE_ON_READ'" +
            ")"
        );
    }
}
```
