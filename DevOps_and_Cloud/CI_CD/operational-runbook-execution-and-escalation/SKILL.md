# Operational [Runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) Execution and Escalation

## Purpose

At entry level, the highest-leverage skill isn't clever improvisation
under pressure — it's disciplined execution of a documented procedure and
knowing precisely when to stop and hand off rather than push past the
edge of that documentation. A junior engineer who deviates from a [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)
mid-[incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) because a step "looks wrong" or a fix "seems obvious" is
making a judgment call without the system context (blast radius, prior
outages, why the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) says what it says) that would let a senior
engineer make that same call safely. This skill covers executing
[runbooks](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbooks/SKILL.md) and deployment procedures exactly as written, triaging alerts
methodically (acknowledge, assess severity, apply the documented fix or
escalate), recognizing the explicit escalation criteria a [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) should
define, and treating every deviation — successful or not — as material to
document rather than a private workaround, since that documentation is
what turns [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)-following into real operational judgment over time.

## When to use

- You are the first responder on a paged alert and need to identify,
  read, and execute the correct [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) rather than debug from scratch.
- You are running an established deployment, rollback, or maintenance
  procedure (e.g. a documented database failover, a certificate renewal,
  a scaling procedure) that already has a written, approved [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md).
- A [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) step doesn't produce the expected result, or the situation
  doesn't match what the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) describes, and you need to decide
  whether to keep going, try something adjacent, or escalate.
- You've just finished (or handed off) a [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) execution and need to
  document what actually happened, including any deviation from the
  written steps, before closing the ticket.
- You are new to an on-call rotation and need a concrete model for what
  "doing the job well" looks like at this level, as distinct from the
  independent design/RCA work covered at the next level in
  [independent-solution-design-and-technical-review](../[independent-solution-design-and-technical-review](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Patterns/independent-solution-design-and-technical-review/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

## Prerequisites & environment

- Read access to the team's [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) repository/wiki, mapped from alert
  name/tag to the specific [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) (e.g. an alert's annotation links
  directly to its [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) URL — if it doesn't, that gap itself is worth
  flagging, not silently working around).
- Access to the paging tool (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Grafana OnCall, or
  equivalent) to acknowledge alerts and see the on-call escalation chain
  — see
  [incident-response-and-on-call-management](../../../site-reliability-engineering/skills/[incident-response-and-on-call-management](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Frontend/[incident-response](../../Observability_and_SecOps/[incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md)-response/SKILL.md)-and-[on-call-management](../../Observability_and_SecOps/on-call-management/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  for how severity levels and escalation timeouts are defined at the
  program level; this skill covers executing within that structure as the
  first responder.
- Read access to the relevant logs/[dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md)/metrics the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)
  references for verification steps.
- Scoped, least-privilege access to perform *only* the actions the
  [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) documents (e.g. restart a specific service, run a specific
  script) — not blanket production admin access "just in case." If a
  [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) step requires access you don't have, that is itself an
  escalation trigger, not a reason to find a workaround with broader
  credentials.
- A known, current escalation path: who is secondary on-call, what their
  timeout is, and how to reach them (page, phone, chat) if the primary
  channel doesn't get a response.
- A place to log deviations and post-shift notes (a ticket, a shared
  on-call log, a [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)-feedback channel) that a [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) owner actually
  reviews — logging into a void that nobody reads defeats the purpose.

## Step-by-step guidance

1. **Acknowledge the alert immediately** in the paging tool, before doing
   anything else — an unacknowledged page that later escalates to a
   colleague when you were in fact already responding wastes their time
   and muddies the [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) record.

2. **Identify the correct [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) from the alert itself**, not from
   memory or a guess at what's probably wrong. Most well-instrumented
   alerts link directly to a [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) URL in their annotation/description;
   if this one doesn't, say so explicitly when you escalate or write up
   the shift rather than proceeding on assumption.

3. **Assess severity using the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)'s/team's documented triage
   criteria**, not personal judgment made under pressure. A [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)
   should tell you what to check to classify severity (customer impact,
   error rate threshold, which systems are affected) and what severity
   implies for urgency and further paging — see the severity-level
   framing in
   [incident-response-and-on-call-management](../../../site-reliability-engineering/skills/[incident-response-and-on-call-management](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Frontend/[incident-response](../../Observability_and_SecOps/[incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md)-response/SKILL.md)-and-[on-call-management](../../Observability_and_SecOps/on-call-management/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

4. **Execute the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)'s steps in order, verifying after each one**,
   rather than running several actions back-to-back and checking once at
   the end — if step 3 doesn't produce the stated expected result, that
   is information you need before deciding whether step 4 is still safe
   to run.

   Example [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) excerpt (`[runbooks](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbooks/SKILL.md)/payments-api-high-memory.md`):
   ```markdown
   # [Runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md): payments-api high memory usage alert

   ## Trigger
   Alert `payments-api-memory-p95-high` fires when container memory
   usage exceeds 85% for 10 minutes.

   ## Severity
   Sev3 by default (no customer impact yet). Escalate to Sev2 immediately
   if error rate also exceeds 1% (check the `payments-api` Grafana
   dashboard, "Error Rate" panel).

   ## Steps
   1. Confirm the alert is real: check the "Memory Usage" panel on the
      `payments-api` Grafana dashboard. Expected: sustained >85% for the
      affected pod(s).
   2. Check for a recent deploy: `[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) rollout history deployment/payments-api -n payments`.
      If a deploy occurred in the last 2 hours, STOP here and escalate
      per the "Escalation triggers" section below — do not proceed to
      step 3. A memory regression tied to a recent deploy needs the
      deploying engineer or a senior engineer, not a restart.
   3. If no recent deploy, restart the affected pod:
      `[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) delete pod <pod-name> -n payments` (the Deployment will
      recreate it — this is a documented, approved action for this
      alert, not an ad hoc restart).
   4. Verify: memory usage on the new pod stays under 70% for 15 minutes
      and the "Error Rate" panel shows no change.
   5. If memory climbs back above 85% within 1 hour of the restart, STOP
      — this is recurring, not a one-off blip. Escalate per below.

   ## Escalation triggers (stop and hand off, do not improvise past this point)
   - A recent deploy correlates with the alert (step 2).
   - The problem recurs within 1 hour of the documented fix (step 5).
   - Error rate crosses 1% at any point (reclassify Sev2, page secondary
     on-call immediately per the on-call escalation policy).
   - Any step's actual result doesn't match its "expected" description.

   ## Escalation contact
   Secondary on-call via PagerDuty schedule `payments-secondary-oncall`.
   ```

5. **Treat the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)'s escalation triggers as hard stops, not
   suggestions.** If you hit one, escalate — do not attempt an adjacent
   fix that isn't in the document, even if you have a hunch it would
   work. The [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)'s escalation point exists specifically because
   someone with more context decided this is where judgment calls need
   more information than a first responder has by design.

6. **Escalate with a structured handoff**, not a vague "it's still
   broken": state what alert fired, what [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) you followed, exactly
   which step you're stopped at and why, what you observed at each prior
   step, and current system state. A senior engineer picking this up
   should not have to re-derive what you already know.

7. **After resolution or handoff, log any deviation from the written
   [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)** — a step that didn't match reality, an escalation trigger
   that fired, a step whose instructions were ambiguous — in the shift
   log or a ticket, even if you worked around it successfully in the
   moment. This is what lets the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) owner fix the document instead
   of the same ambiguity tripping up the next first responder too.

## Best practices

- Treat the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) as ground truth for the duration of the [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md),
  even if you believe you know a faster or better way — propose the
  improvement afterward, as a documented change to the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md), not as a
  live improvisation during an active page.
- Timebox each step mentally before you start it (the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)'s stated
  timeout, or a sane default if none is given) so a hung step becomes a
  decision point rather than something you sit and wait on indefinitely.
- Verify after every step, not just at the end — cheap, frequent
  verification catches a step that silently didn't do what you expected
  long before it compounds into a bigger problem.
- Escalate early rather than late. Escalating a problem that turns out to
  be simple costs a few minutes of a senior engineer's time; sitting on a
  problem past the documented escalation trigger while you keep trying
  costs much more once it's finally handed off in a worse state.
- When a [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) step is ambiguous, out of date, or simply wrong, say so
  explicitly in the [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) record and follow up with a ticket to fix
  the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) — don't silently "figure it out" and leave the document
  wrong for the next person.
- Keep a personal (or team) log of every [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) you've executed and
  every deviation you noted — reviewing that log periodically is how
  judgment about *why* the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) says what it says actually builds over
  time, ahead of eventually working more independently as covered in
  [independent-solution-design-and-technical-review](../[independent-solution-design-and-technical-review](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Patterns/independent-solution-design-and-technical-review/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** A [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) step's escalation trigger is met (e.g. "a recent
  deploy correlates with the alert — stop and escalate"), but the
  responder feels confident and tries an unlisted fix instead of
  escalating.
  **Fix:** This is a genuinely risky pitfall, not a minor process
  miss — improvising past a documented escalation point removes the
  safety margin the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)'s author built in deliberately, often based
  on a prior [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) where exactly this improvisation made things
  worse. Escalate at the trigger every time, regardless of how confident
  the fix feels in the moment; note the idea in the handoff so the
  escalated engineer can evaluate it with full context instead of it
  being tried blind.

- **Symptom:** A [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) step's "expected result" clearly doesn't match
  what's actually observed, but the responder proceeds to the next step
  anyway on the assumption it'll probably be fine.
  **Fix:** Stop at the first mismatch between expected and actual result
  and treat it as an implicit escalation trigger even if the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)
  doesn't name that exact case — a [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)'s steps are usually written
  assuming each prior step succeeded as documented; proceeding on an
  unverified assumption compounds the uncertainty with each subsequent
  step.

- **Symptom:** An alert fires at 2am, the assigned [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) is two
  versions out of date and references a service that was renamed six
  months ago, and the responder spends 40 minutes trying to reconcile it
  before finally escalating.
  **Fix:** If the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) clearly doesn't match current reality within
  the first few minutes, escalate immediately and flag the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) as
  stale in the same message — don't burn the acute [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) window
  trying to privately reverse-engineer a broken document; fixing the
  document is separate, follow-up work.

- **Symptom:** A responder performs an action that isn't in the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)
  at all — for example, restarting a production database, force-deleting
  a stuck [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md) resource, or manually editing data — because it
  "should" fix the symptom, without any documented approval for that
  specific action.
  **Fix:** This is a destructive-action risk, not routine
  troubleshooting: any action with a real risk of data loss or wider
  outage that isn't explicitly documented and approved in the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) is
  outside a first responder's authorized scope. Escalate instead, and if
  a genuinely useful undocumented action gets approved by whoever you
  escalate to, get it added to the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) afterward so it's a documented
  step next time, not a one-off judgment call repeated informally.

- **Symptom:** A shift ends, the ticket is closed as resolved, and no
  note is made that step 3 of the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) actually failed the first time
  and had to be retried — three weeks later, the next responder hits the
  identical failure and has no idea it happened before.
  **Fix:** Log every deviation, even ones that resolved themselves on
  retry, in the shift log or ticket before closing — a [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) owner who
  never sees these reports has no signal that the document needs
  updating, and the same friction repeats for every future first
  responder.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** At 03:14 UTC, alert `checkout-api-error-rate-high` pages
the on-call rotation for a junior engineer's first solo overnight shift.

1. **Acknowledge** the page in PagerDuty within 90 seconds.
2. **Find the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)** via the alert's linked
   `[runbooks](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbooks/SKILL.md)/checkout-api-error-rate.md` — it exists and looks current.
3. **Assess severity**: the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)'s triage step says check the "5xx
   rate" panel; it's at 4%, above the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)'s documented 2% Sev2
   threshold — classify Sev2 and note it in the [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) channel per the
   severity table in
   [incident-response-and-on-call-management](../../../site-reliability-engineering/skills/[incident-response-and-on-call-management](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Frontend/[incident-response](../../Observability_and_SecOps/[incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md)-response/SKILL.md)-and-[on-call-management](../../Observability_and_SecOps/on-call-management/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).
4. **Execute step 1**: check for a recent deploy — none in the last 6
   hours. Proceed.
5. **Execute step 2**: restart the two flagged pods per the documented
   command. Verify per step 3: 5xx rate drops to 0.3% within 5 minutes,
   matching the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)'s "expected" description. Looks resolved.
6. **Execute step 4 (final verification)**: hold for 15 minutes as
   instructed. At minute 12, the 5xx rate climbs back to 3.8%.
7. **This matches an explicit escalation trigger** ("recurs within 30
   minutes of the fix") — the engineer does not attempt a second restart
   or try anything else. They page secondary on-call with a structured
   handoff: alert name, [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) followed, steps 1-4 completed with
   results, the recurrence at minute 12, and current 5xx rate.
8. Secondary on-call (a senior engineer) picks it up, and — because this
   didn't have a documented fix beyond the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)'s scope — proceeds
   under
   [independent-solution-design-and-technical-review](../[independent-solution-design-and-technical-review](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Patterns/independent-solution-design-and-technical-review/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)'s
   root-cause process rather than the [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md).
9. **After stand-down**, the junior engineer logs the deviation in the
   [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) ticket: "[runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)'s restart step resolved symptoms for ~12
   minutes before recurrence; escalated per the recurrence trigger;
   root cause was a connection-pool leak not covered by this [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md)."
   This note becomes the seed of a [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) update once the senior
   engineer's root-cause fix (see cross-reference) is confirmed.
