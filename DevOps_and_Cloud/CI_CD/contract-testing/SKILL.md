# Quality Contract Testing

## Purpose
Implement consumer-driven contract testing with Pact to verify API compatibility between services without brittle integration tests.

## Agent Protocol

### Trigger
Exact user phrases: "contract testing", "Pact", "Spring Cloud Contract", "consumer-driven contract", "provider contract", "API compatibility", "integration testing", "contract verification", "Pact broker", "CDC", "breaking change".

### Input Context
Before activating, verify:
- Service architecture (monolith, microservices, event-driven)
- Consumer and provider service names
- Communication protocol (HTTP REST, gRPC, async messaging)
- Existing test frameworks and CI setup

### Output Artifact
Contract testing setup with Pact consumer tests, provider verification, and CI pipeline configuration.

### Response Format
```yaml
# Contract architecture: consumers, providers, interactions
# Pact Broker configuration
```
```typescript
// Consumer test example
// Provider verification setup
```

No preamble. No postamble. No explanations. No filler/hedging/transitions. Compress output — why use many token when few do trick.

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] Consumer tests written for each API interaction
- [ ] Pact contracts generated and published to broker
- [ ] Provider verification tests configured
- [ ] Pact Broker deployed or SaaS configured
- [ ] CI pipeline with contract verification step

### Max Response Length
200 lines of configuration and test code.

## Consumer-Driven Contracts

### Pact Overview
Pact is a consumer-driven contract testing framework. The consumer defines the expected interaction (request + response) in a test. Pact generates a contract file from the consumer test. The contract is published to a Pact Broker. The provider fetches the contract and verifies it against the actual API. If verification fails, the provider cannot deploy.

### Consumer Test Setup (TypeScript)
Consumer tests define the expected request and response for each API interaction. Tests run against a mock provider started by Pact. Each interaction specifies: a description of what the consumer expects to receive, the provider state that must be set up before verification, the request details (method, path, headers, body), and the expected response (status, headers, body).

### Provider Verification Setup
Provider tests fetch the latest consumer contracts from the Pact Broker and verify each interaction against the provider's actual API. The provider starts a test server, runs the contract verifier, and checks that each consumer interaction's response matches the actual response. Provider states are set up via API calls to the provider's test endpoints or database seeding.

### Pact Broker Deployment
The Pact Broker stores contracts, verification results, and matrices of compatible versions. It can be self-hosted via Docker Compose or used as a SaaS product (PactFlow). The Broker exposes a web UI showing the network diagram of all service dependencies. Webhooks can be configured to notify consumers when a provider publishes a new verification result or whena contract changes.

### Versioning and Compatibility
Contracts are versioned by the consumer's application version (Git commit SHA). Tags identify which version is deployed to each environment (dev, staging, production). The can-i-deploy tool checks the Pact Broker for compatibility before any deployment. The Broker maintains a matrix of compatible consumer and provider versions.

### Breaking Change Detection
When a provider change breaks a consumer contract, the Broker shows exactly which consumer is affected, which interaction failed, and the exact response diff. The developer fixes the issue by making the change backward compatible (add new endpoint instead of modifying existing, add optional fields) or coordinating a multi-service deployment.

### CI Pipeline Integration
Consumer CI: test → publish pact → tag version. Provider CI: fetch pending contracts → verify → report results. Deployment check: can-i-deploy verifies all consumer contracts pass before provider deploys. The pipeline blocks deployment if can-i-deploy fails.

### Spring Cloud Contract Alternative
Spring Cloud Contract provides Groovy-based contract definitions for JVM projects. Contracts are defined as Groovy DSL files alongside the provider code. The provider generates a test stub from the contract. Consumer-side tests use the WireMock stub generated from the contract. Contracts are stored in a Git repository or Artifactory instead of a Pact Broker.

### WebSphere MQ Contract Testing
For messaging contracts, Pact supports message pacts. A message pact defines the expected message payload (key-value pairs or serialized objects) that the consumer expects from a message queue. The provider verification starts the message producer and checks that the produced message matches the expected format and content. Pact Broker stores message pacts alongside HTTP pacts.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pact Setup
Install Pact CLI and Pact library for each language: `@pact-foundation/pact` (JS), `pact` (Ruby), `pact-jvm` (JVM), `pact-python`. Deploy Pact Broker (OSS or PactFlow SaaS) for contract sharing. Each consumer-provider pair has exactly one set of contracts.

### Step 2: Consumer Test
```typescript
// consumer test (order-service tests payment-service)
await provider.addInteraction({
  state: "a payment exists",
  uponReceiving: "a request for payment status",
  withRequest: { method: "GET", path: "/payments/123" },
  willRespondWith: {
    status: 200,
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: { id: "123", status: "confirmed", amount: 49.99 },
  },
});
```

### Step 3: Provider Verification
Provider verifies all consumer contracts in CI. Run Pact verification against provider API — each interaction's request is sent, response checked against expected. Provider verification must be fast (< 1 min per contract).

### Step 4: Pact Broker
Publish contracts from consumer CI: `pact-broker publish ./pacts --consumer-app-version <sha> --tag <branch>`. Provider CI fetches latest contracts: `pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant <service> --version <sha>`. Broker shows network diagram of all service dependencies.

### Step 5: CI Pipeline
Consumer CI: test → publish pact → tag version. Provider CI: fetch pending contracts → verify → report results. Deployment check: `can-i-deploy` verifies all consumer contracts pass before provider deploys. Matrix of compatible versions stored in broker.

### Step 6: Breaking Change Detection
When a provider change breaks a consumer contract: developer sees which consumer is affected, which interaction failed, and the exact diff. Fix options: 1) add new endpoint (deprecate old), 2) add optional field (backward compatible), 3) coordinate deploy with consumer.

### Step 7: Version Compatibility
Backward compatibility requires that new provider satisfies all existing consumer contracts. Use `pact-broker can-i-deploy` as deployment gate. For breaking changes: deploy new provider version alongside old, migrate consumers, remove old contracts.

## Consumer-Provider Interaction Matrix

| Consumer | Provider | Protocol | Endpoints | Contracts |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OrderService | PaymentService | HTTP REST | GET /payments/:id, POST /payments | 3 interactions |
| OrderService | InventoryService | HTTP REST | GET /inventory/:sku, POST /inventory/reserve | 2 interactions |
| NotificationService | UserService | gRPC | GetUserPreferences, UpdatePreferences | 2 RPCs |
| DataPipeline | OrderService | HTTP REST | GET /orders/bulk | 1 interaction |
| Dashboard | AnalyticsService | Async (MQ) | order_metrics_updated event | 1 message pact |

## Pact Verification Matrix

| Provider Version | Consumer Version | Payment Contract | Inventory Contract | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v2.3.0 | OrderService v1.5.0 | ✅ Pass | ✅ Pass | Compatible |
| v2.3.0 | OrderService v1.4.0 | ✅ Pass | ❌ Fail (new endpoint) | Breaking change |
| v2.3.0 | NotificationService v3.1.0 | — | — | No contract |
| v2.2.0 | OrderService v1.5.0 | ✅ Pass | ✅ Pass | Compatible |

## Contract Testing vs E2E Testing

| Aspect | Contract Testing | E2E Testing |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Single provider-consumer pair | Entire system |
| Speed | Fast (< 1 min per contract) | Slow (10-60 min) |
| Reliability | High (deterministic) | Low (flaky) |
| Failure diagnosis | Exact diff shown | Requires log analysis |
| Deployment blocking | Yes (can-i-deploy) | No (informational) |
| Environment | CI pipeline | Full staging environment |
| Test data | Provider states | Real data |

## Contract Testing Maturity Model

| Level | Characteristics | Practices |
|---|---|---|
| 1: Initial | Ad-hoc integration tests | Manual API testing, brittle E2E suites |
| 2: Defined | Basic consumer tests | Single consumer, no broker, manual verification |
| 3: Managed | Broker with CI integration | Pact Broker, CI verification, canary checks |
| 4: Measured | Multi-service contracts | All services covered, webhook alerts, trend reports |
| 5: Optimized | Cross-team contract governance | Contract review board, automated compatibility gates, SLA dashboards |

## Contract Testing Examples

### TypeScript — Consumer Test with Pact
```typescript
// consumer/order-service/src/__tests__/payment-client.pact.test.ts
import { PactV3, MatchersV3 } from "@pact-foundation/pact";
import { PaymentClient } from "../payment-client";

const provider = new PactV3({
  consumer: "order-service",
  provider: "payment-service",
});

describe("Payment Service Pact", () => {
  it("returns payment status for existing payment", async () => {
    provider
      .given("a payment exists")
      .uponReceiving("a request for payment status")
      .withRequest({
        method: "GET",
        path: "/payments/123",
        headers: { Accept: "application/json" },
      })
      .willRespondWith({
        status: 200,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: {
          id: MatchersV3.string("123"),
          status: MatchersV3.term({
            generate: "confirmed",
            matcher: "^(confirmed|pending|failed)$",
          }),
          amount: MatchersV3.decimal(49.99),
        },
      });

    await provider.executeTest(async (mockServer) => {
      const client = new PaymentClient(mockServer.url);
      const response = await client.getPaymentStatus("123");
      expect(response.status).toBe("confirmed");
      expect(response.amount).toBe(49.99);
    });
  });

  it("returns 404 for non-existent payment", async () => {
    provider
      .given("a payment does not exist")
      .uponReceiving("a request for non-existent payment")
      .withRequest({
        method: "GET",
        path: "/payments/999",
        headers: { Accept: "application/json" },
      })
      .willRespondWith({
        status: 404,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: { error: "Payment not found" },
      });

    await provider.executeTest(async (mockServer) => {
      const client = new PaymentClient(mockServer.url);
      await expect(client.getPaymentStatus("999")).rejects.toThrow("Payment not found");
    });
  });
});
```

import atexit
import pytest
from pact import Consumer, Provider

pact = Consumer("order-service").has_pact_with(
    Provider("payment-service"),
    pact_dir="./pacts",
    host_name="localhost",
    port=1234,
)
pact.start_service()
atexit.register(pact.stop_service)

class TestPaymentClient:
    def test_get_payment_status(self):
        expected = {
            "id": "123",
            "status": "confirmed",
            "amount": 49.99,
        }
        (pact
         .given("a payment exists")
         .upon_receiving("a request for payment status")
         .with_request(method="GET", path="/payments/123")
         .will_respond_with(200, body=expected))

        with pact:
            client = PaymentClient(f"http://localhost:{pact.port}")
            result = client.get_payment_status("123")
            assert result == expected

    def test_payment_not_found(self):
        (pact
         .given("a payment does not exist")
         .upon_receiving("a request for non-existent payment")
         .with_request(method="GET", path="/payments/999")

## Contract Testing Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: No Pact Broker
Sharing contract files via email, shared drives, or Git submodules instead of using a Pact Broker. Without a broker, there's no central source of truth, no verification matrix, and no can-i-deploy capability. Deploy the Pact Broker (OSS Docker Compose) or use PactFlow SaaS.

### Anti-Pattern: Testing Everything with Contracts
Writing Pact tests for every single API endpoint creates maintenance overhead without proportional benefit. Use contracts for inter-service boundaries where changes in one service could break another. Monolith internal modules and third-party APIs with stable contracts don't need Pact.

### Anti-Pattern: No Provider State Setup
Provider verification without setting up the correct state produces false positives or false negatives. If a consumer expects "a payment exists," the provider must seed that data before verification. Define provider states with API calls or database seeding.

### Anti-Pattern: Ignoring can-i-deploy
Deploying a provider without running `can-i-deploy` against the Pact Broker means you're deploying blind. The provider might have broken one or more consumer contracts. `can-i-deploy` must gate all provider deployments.

### Anti-Pattern: Contract Changes Without Consumer Coordination
Modifying a provider endpoint (changing response shape, removing fields) without coordinating with consumers. The consumer contracts define what consumers expect. Breaking changes must be communicated, coordinated, and deployed in a compatible order.

### Anti-Pattern: No Webhook Notifications
When a provider verification fails, the affected consumer team must be notified immediately. Without webhooks, failures are discovered when the consumer tries to deploy and can-i-deploy fails. Configure Pact Broker webhooks to notify on verification failures.

## Contract Testing Maturity Model

| Level | Characteristics | Practices |
|---|---|---|
| 1: Initial | No contract testing | Brittle integration tests, manual API coordination, frequent breaking changes in production |
| 2: Defined | Basic consumer contracts | Single consumer-provider pair, Pact tests for critical endpoints, no broker, manual verification |
| 3: Managed | Broker with CI gates | Pact Broker deployed, consumer contracts published in CI, provider verification in CI, can-i-deploy gating deployments |
| 4: Measured | Multi-service contract coverage | All inter-service boundaries covered, webhook alerts on failures, version compatibility matrix tracked, canary release supported |
| 5: Optimized | Contract-driven architecture | Contracts defined before implementation (contract-first), automated compatibility gates across environments, cross-team contract review board, SLA dashboards |

## Performance Considerations

- Contract test execution: consumer tests complete in < 1s per interaction (mock provider). Provider verification takes 1-5s per contract.
- Pact Broker operations: publish (< 500ms), verify CAN-I-DEPLOY (< 200ms), fetch contracts (< 200ms).
- Pact Broker storage: contracts are JSON files 2-50KB each. 1000 contracts = 50MB.
- CI pipeline impact: consumer contract tests add < 2 minutes. Provider verification adds < 5 minutes.
- Pact Broker deployment: Docker Compose with PostgreSQL backend. Minimum 1GB RAM, 2 CPU cores.

## Rules
- Every consumer-provider pair has its own Pact contract file
- Contracts are published on every consumer CI run
- Provider verifies ALL consumer contracts before deployment
- can-i-deploy gates all deployments — no bypass
- Contract versions are tagged by environment (dev, staging, prod)
- Never delete a contract — mark as deprecated
- Webhook on verification failure notifies affected teams
- Pact contract = executable documentation
- Providers verify contracts before deploying to staging
- Consumer contracts define what the provider must support
- Provider states must be documented and implemented before verification
- Contracts must include both happy path and error response scenarios
- can-i-deploy checks must run before any production deployment
- Contract changes follow API versioning policy — no breaking changes without migration

## Implementation Patterns

### Observer Pattern for Event Handling
`
interface EventObserver<T> {
  onEvent(event: T): Promise<void>;
}

class EventBus<T> {
  private observers: Set<EventObserver<T>> = new Set();
  subscribe(observer: EventObserver<T>): void {
    this.observers.add(observer);
  }
  unsubscribe(observer: EventObserver<T>): void {
    this.observers.delete(observer);
  }
  async emit(event: T): Promise<void> {
    const results = Array.from(this.observers).map(o => o.onEvent(event));
    await Promise.allSettled(results);
  }
}
`

### Configuration-Driven Approach
`
config:
  defaults:
    timeout: 30s
    retryCount: 3
  overrides:
    production:
      timeout: 60s
      retryCount: 5
    development:
      timeout: 300s
      retryCount: 1
`

## Production Considerations

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Configuration validated against schema before startup
- [ ] Health check endpoints registered and monitored
- [ ] Graceful shutdown with draining period (30s timeout)
- [ ] Resource limits configured (CPU, memory, file descriptors)
- [ ] Log level set appropriate for environment
- [ ] Metrics endpoint secured and exposed
- [ ] Rate limiting configured per-tier
- [ ] TLS certificates valid and auto-renewing
- [ ] Database migrations run as separate deployment step
- [ ] Feature flags ready for gradual rollout

### Monitoring and Alerting
| Metric | Threshold | Severity | Action |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Error rate | > 1% over 5min | Critical | Page on-call |
| p99 latency | > 2s over 5min | Warning | Investigate |
| Throughput drop | > 50% over 1min | Critical | Check upstream |
| Queue depth | > 1000 over 1min | Warning | Scale consumers |
| Disk usage | > 85% | Warning | Clean or expand |
| Memory usage | > 90% heap | Critical | Restart or scale |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Solution |
|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Premature optimization | Complex code for no measured benefit | Guessing instead of profiling | Measure first, optimize based on data |
| Copy-paste reuse | Duplicate code across codebase | Lack of abstraction | Extract shared logic into libraries |
| Gold-plating | Features with no current requirement | Over-engineering | YAGNI — build what's needed now |
| Magical thinking | Assumptions without validation | Skipping error handling | Handle all failure modes explicitly |

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
Cache hierarchy: L1 (in-memory local) → L2 (distributed Redis/Memcached) → L3 (CDN/Edge).
Cache invalidation: TTL-based (simple, stale), event-based (complex, fresh), write-through (consistent, higher write latency), write-behind (fast writes, eventual consistency).

### Resource Pooling
- Database connections: Pool of reusable connections (HikariCP, pgBouncer)
- HTTP connections: Keep-alive + connection pooling for external calls
- Thread pool: Bounded thread pools for async task execution

### Profiling Methodology
1. Establish baseline with production traffic profile
2. Profile CPU with sampling profiler (pprof, perf, async-profiler)
3. Profile memory with heap dumps and allocation tracking
4. Profile I/O with strace/perf trace for syscall analysis
5. Profile latency with distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
6. Identify bottleneck, formulate hypothesis, implement fix
7. Re-profile to verify improvement, repeat

## Security Considerations

### Threat Modeling (STRIDE)
- Spoofing: Identity validation, authentication
- Tampering: Integrity checks, digital signatures
- Repudiation: Audit logs, non-repudiation
- Information disclosure: Encryption, access control
- Denial of service: Rate limiting, resource quotas
- Elevation of privilege: Principle of least privilege

### Supply Chain Security
- Dependency scanning: Snyk, Dependabot, Trivy
- SBOM generation: CycloneDX or SPDX format
- Signed commits: GPG or SSH commit signing
- Artifact verification: Checksum validation, signature verification

### Secrets Management
- Secrets never in code — always in secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Rotation policy: Rotate database credentials every 90 days
- Access audit: Log every secrets access, alert on anomalies
- Encryption at rest and in transit for all secrets
- Principle of least privilege: each service gets only its own secrets

## Rules
- Default-deny security posture — allow only explicitly required access.
- All inputs validated, all outputs encoded, all errors handled.
- Defend in depth — multiple layers of security controls.
- Fail securely — errors default to safe behavior.
- Log security-relevant events for audit and investigation.
- Keep dependencies updated — automate vulnerability scanning.
- Design for observability from day one, not as an afterthought.
- Document all architectural decisions with rationale.
- Review code for security, performance, and correctness before merging.
## Architecture Decision Trees

### Contract Testing Strategy
| Decision Point | Option A | Option B | Decision Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Protocol | HTTP/REST (most common) | Async/Message queue (event-driven) | Service communication pattern |
| Tool choice | Pact (mature, broad support) | Spring Cloud Contract (JVM-focused) | Tech stack, team familiarity |
| Contract location | Pact Broker (shared, versioned) | Git repository (code-reviewed) | CI integration, cross-team visibility |
| Verification timing | CI pipeline (every commit) | Scheduled (nightly) | Change frequency, team coordination |

### Provider Verification Scope
- All consumer contracts → Full verification, safe but slower
- Changed contracts only → Fast but risk missing broken contracts
- Tagged contracts → Only verify contracts for current env tag
