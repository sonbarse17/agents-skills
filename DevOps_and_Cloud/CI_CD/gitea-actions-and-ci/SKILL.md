# Gitea Actions and CI

## Purpose

Gitea Actions gives a self-hosted Gitea (or Forgejo) instance a CI system
that intentionally mirrors [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) Actions' workflow YAML syntax
(`.gitea/workflows/*.yml`, `on:`/`jobs:`/`steps:`), executed by a
self-hosted **act_runner** rather than [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md)'s managed runners. This
matters operationally because most [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) Actions YAML is *reusable with
caveats*, but the caveats — a smaller set of built-in contexts, no
[GitHub](../github/SKILL.md)-hosted runner equivalent, different marketplace-action
compatibility, and a distinct runner registration/labeling model — cause
real friction when a team assumes full parity. This skill covers Gitea
Actions setup and specifically where it diverges from
[github-actions-single-repo-workflows](../[github-actions-single-repo-workflows](../[github-actions](../[github](../github/SKILL.md)-actions/SKILL.md)-single-repo-workflows/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md),
which this skill assumes as the baseline syntax reference.

## When to use

- A team self-hosts Gitea (or Forgejo, a Gitea fork) and wants to enable
  built-in CI instead of bolting on an external [Jenkins](../jenkins/SKILL.md)/Drone instance.
- Porting an existing [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) Actions workflow to run on Gitea and hitting
  unsupported syntax, contexts, or marketplace actions.
- Setting up and registering a self-hosted `act_runner` against a Gitea
  instance, or debugging why a workflow job never picks up a runner.
- Deciding which third-party [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) Actions marketplace actions are safe/
  compatible to reuse on Gitea Actions versus needing a local
  reimplementation.
- Auditing self-hosted runner security posture, since every Gitea Actions
  runner is self-hosted by definition (no managed-runner option).

## Prerequisites & environment

- A Gitea instance (1.19+ for Actions support; check **Site Administration
  → Actions** to confirm Actions is enabled instance-wide, since it's
  opt-in and off by default in older versions) or a Forgejo instance
  (Forgejo Actions is the same underlying design, forked from Gitea's).
- At least one **act_runner** binary or container registered against the
  instance — Gitea does not provide managed/hosted runners; every runner
  is infrastructure the team stands up and maintains itself.
- [Docker](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/docker/SKILL.md) (or another supported executor) on the runner host if workflows
  use container-based steps/actions, since act_runner's default executor
  model relies on [Docker](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/docker/SKILL.md) to run job containers, similar to
  `act`(the local [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) Actions runner it's derived from).
- Repo or org admin access to enable Actions per-repository (**Repository
  Settings → Actions**) and to view/manage registered runners
  (**Site Administration → Actions → Runners**, or org/repo-level runner
  registration for scoped runners).
- Familiarity with [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) Actions workflow YAML — see
  [github-actions-single-repo-workflows](../[github-actions-single-repo-workflows](../[github-actions](../[github](../github/SKILL.md)-actions/SKILL.md)-single-repo-workflows/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  for the baseline syntax this skill assumes.

## Step-by-step guidance

1. **Enable Actions at the instance level first**, then per-repo — Gitea
   Actions is disabled by default at both levels historically; confirm
   **Site Administration → Actions → Actions** is enabled before debugging
   a repo that "has no CI" for any other reason.

2. **Register at least one act_runner.** Download/run the `act_runner`
   binary or container, generate a registration token from the instance
   (**Site Administration → Actions → Runners → Create new Runner**, or
   `gitea actions generate-runner-token` on the server), and register:
   ```bash
   act_runner register \
     --instance https://gitea.example.com \
     --token ${GITEA_RUNNER_TOKEN} \
     --name ci-runner-1 \
     --labels ubuntu-latest:[docker](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/docker/SKILL.md)://node:20-bullseye,linux_amd64
   act_runner daemon
   ```
   The `--labels` mapping is important: unlike [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md)-hosted runners,
   act_runner's labels are locally defined and must explicitly map a
   label like `ubuntu-latest` to a container image — there is no implicit
   [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md)-managed `ubuntu-latest` image behind the scenes.

3. **Write the workflow under `.gitea/workflows/`, not
   `.[github](../github/SKILL.md)/workflows/`** — this is the single most common porting
   mistake:
   ```yaml
   # .gitea/workflows/ci.yml
   name: ci
   on:
     pull_request:
       branches: [main]
     push:
       branches: [main]
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
           with: { node-version: "20" }
         - run: npm ci
         - run: npm test
   ```

4. **Verify marketplace action compatibility before relying on one.**
   Gitea Actions supports actions written for [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) Actions in principle
   (it runs the same `action.yml` format), but actions calling [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md)-
   specific REST APIs (e.g. posting a check run via the [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) API,
   using `actions/[github](../github/SKILL.md)-script` against `[github](../github/SKILL.md).com` endpoints) won't
   work unmodified against a Gitea instance — prefer generic shell-based
   actions or Gitea-specific forks (many popular actions have a
   `https://gitea.com/...` mirror maintained for this reason) for
   anything that talks to the forge's API directly.

5. **Use `[docker](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/docker/SKILL.md)://` prefixed images for portability** where an action
   needs a specific toolchain, since act_runner's default execution model
   is container-based and this keeps behavior consistent across runner
   hosts:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: [docker](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/docker/SKILL.md)
       container:
         image: golang:1.22-bookworm
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - run: go build ./...
   ```

6. **Scope runners deliberately** (instance-wide, org-level, or
   repo-level registration) matching your trust boundary — a repo-scoped
   runner only picks up jobs from that one repo, which limits blast radius
   if a workflow in one repo were to run malicious code, versus an
   instance-wide runner available to every repo on the instance.

7. **Treat every runner host as sensitive infrastructure**, since (unlike
   [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md)-hosted runners, which are ephemeral and managed by [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md)) a
   self-hosted act_runner persists state and credentials on infrastructure
   your team fully controls and must patch/harden itself — apply the same
   self-hosted-runner security posture called out generically in
   [ci-cd-pipeline-design](../../../devops/skills/[ci-cd-pipeline-design](../ci-cd-pipeline-design/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

8. **Check job/runner matching when a job never starts.** A job with
   `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` stays queued forever if no registered runner
   advertises that exact label — confirm via **Site Administration →
   Actions → Runners** (or org/repo scoped runner list) which labels are
   actually registered.

## Best practices

- Keep `.gitea/workflows/*.yml` syntax close to plain [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) Actions YAML
  (avoid Gitea-only extensions unless necessary) if there's any chance of
  needing to run the same repo on [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) too — this maximizes portability
  in both directions.
- Explicitly document each registered runner's labels-to-image mapping
  (e.g. in a README in the runner's provisioning repo/IaC) since, unlike
  [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md)'s implicit `ubuntu-latest`/`macos-latest` meaning, Gitea's labels
  are whatever the team defined at registration time and can silently
  diverge between runner hosts if not centrally managed.
- Prefer Gitea-maintained or generic shell-based mirrors of common
  actions (checkout, setup-node, setup-go, [docker](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/docker/SKILL.md) build/push) over
  [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md)-API-dependent marketplace actions, and test any ported action
  against Gitea before assuming parity.
- Register runners per-scope (repo/org/instance) matching trust
  boundaries rather than defaulting every runner to instance-wide access.
- Since there's no managed-runner tier, budget for the operational load
  of patching runner hosts (OS updates, [Docker](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/docker/SKILL.md) version, act_runner binary
  updates) yourself — this is real infrastructure ownership, not a
  toggle.
- Pin action versions the same way as [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) Actions
  (`actions/checkout@v4`, not `@main`) — see
  [github-actions-single-repo-workflows](../[github-actions-single-repo-workflows](../[github-actions](../[github](../github/SKILL.md)-actions/SKILL.md)-single-repo-workflows/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  for why this matters, and it applies identically here.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** A workflow file exists in the repo but no CI ever runs, no
  error shown anywhere obvious.
  **Fix:** Check the file is under `.gitea/workflows/`, not
  `.[github](../github/SKILL.md)/workflows/` (a straight copy from a [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md)-based repo commonly
  leaves it in the wrong path), and confirm Actions is enabled both
  instance-wide (**Site Administration → Actions**) and for the specific
  repository (**Repository Settings → Actions**).

- **Symptom:** A job stays queued/pending indefinitely and never starts.
  **Fix:** No registered act_runner advertises the label in `runs-on:`
  (e.g. `ubuntu-latest`) — check **Site Administration → Actions →
  Runners** for the actual registered labels, and either register a
  runner with that label or change `runs-on:` to match an existing one.

- **Symptom:** A marketplace action that works fine on [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) Actions
  fails on Gitea with an API error or silently no-ops (e.g. an action
  that's supposed to post a PR comment via the [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) API does nothing).
  **Fix:** The action is calling [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md)'s REST API directly rather than
  using a forge-agnostic mechanism; look for a Gitea-compatible fork/
  mirror of the action, or replace it with a plain shell step using
  Gitea's own API (`https://gitea.example.com/api/v1/...`) with a
  suitably scoped token.

- **Symptom:** Two different repos' workflows produce different build
  results even though the workflow YAML is identical.
  **Fix:** Runner labels map to specific container images defined at
  registration time on each act_runner host — if two runner hosts were
  registered with the same label (e.g. `ubuntu-latest`) pointing at
  different underlying images/tags, jobs land on inconsistent
  environments; centralize and document the label-to-image mapping so all
  runners advertising a given label are actually equivalent.

- **Symptom:** A self-hosted act_runner host is compromised (unpatched OS,
  exposed [Docker](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/docker/SKILL.md) socket) and used to exfiltrate secrets from every repo
  it services.
  **Fix:** This is the real risk of self-hosted-only runners with no
  managed-runner alternative — treat runner hosts as sensitive
  infrastructure requiring the same patching cadence and network
  isolation as production systems, scope runners per-repo/org rather than
  instance-wide where workflows handle sensitive secrets, and never leave
  the [Docker](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/docker/SKILL.md) socket reachable from job containers unless the workflow
  genuinely and trustedly needs [Docker](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/docker/SKILL.md)-in-[Docker](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/docker/SKILL.md).

## Worked example

**Scenario:** A team self-hosts Gitea for an internal Go service repo and
wants CI on every PR (lint, test, build) using a repo-scoped act_runner,
after previously running the same workflow logic on [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) Actions.

Runner registration (run once on the dedicated CI host):
```bash
act_runner register \
  --instance https://gitea.internal.example.com \
  --token ${GITEA_RUNNER_TOKEN} \
  --name go-service-runner \
  --labels ubuntu-latest:[docker](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/docker/SKILL.md)://golang:1.22-bookworm,linux_amd64
act_runner daemon
```

`.gitea/workflows/ci.yml` (ported from an equivalent
`.[github](../github/SKILL.md)/workflows/ci.yml`, changing only the path and dropping one
[GitHub](../github/SKILL.md)-API-dependent step):
```yaml
name: ci
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: go vet ./...
      - run: go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
      - run: go build -o bin/service ./cmd/service
      - name: Upload coverage artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: coverage
          path: coverage.out
```
The team drops a previously-used `[github](../github/SKILL.md)-script` step that posted a PR
comment via the [GitHub](../github/SKILL.md) REST API (not compatible against a Gitea instance)
and replaces it, where still needed, with a plain `curl` call against
Gitea's own `/api/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{index}/comments`
endpoint using a scoped Gitea access token instead.
