# Argo CD Sync Failure and Drift Investigation

## Purpose

An `Application` reporting `OutOfSync`, stuck `Progressing`, or a failed
sync operation tells you *that* something is wrong but rarely tells you
*why* at a glance — the real cause is buried in a specific resource's
diff, a specific hook Job's pod logs, or the distinction between "Git and
the cluster genuinely disagree" versus "someone changed a live resource
by hand and Argo CD hasn't reconciled it yet." This skill assumes the
`Application` spec itself (sync policy, sync waves, hooks, custom health
checks) is already configured per
[argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-application-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
and goes deep on the investigative workflow for when that configuration
isn't behaving as expected in a running cluster: reading resource-level
diffs, tracing a failing hook to its root cause, and telling manual
cluster drift apart from real Git/cluster divergence before deciding
whether to sync, patch Git, or leave a resource alone.

## When to use

- An `Application` shows `OutOfSync` and it's not obvious which
  resource(s) differ or why.
- An `Application` is stuck `Progressing` past the point it should
  normally settle, or a sync operation is stuck `Running`/`Terminating`.
- A `PreSync`, `Sync`, or `PostSync` hook Job failed, timed out, or is
  blocking the rest of the sync from proceeding.
- Someone ran `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) edit`/`[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) patch`/`[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) scale` directly
  against a resource Argo CD manages, and you need to know whether that
  change will be reverted, silently kept, or is masking a real
  discrepancy with Git.
- An `Application` reports `Synced`/`Healthy` but a user insists the
  cluster is doing something different from what's in Git (or vice
  versa).
- Deciding whether an `OutOfSync` diff represents a resource that should
  be synced from Git, or a field that should instead be added to
  `ignoreDifferences` because the live value is legitimately
  controller-managed.

## Prerequisites & environment

- Argo CD ≥ 2.9 with `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)` CLI access
  (`[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) login <ARGOCD_SERVER>`) and read (at minimum) RBAC on the
  target `Application`/`AppProject`.
- `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md)` access to the destination cluster for direct inspection —
  the `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)` CLI's view is derived from the same live state but is
  sometimes stale relative to a fresh `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get`.
- The `Application`'s Git source repo accessible for comparison
  (`git log`, `git blame` on the manifest path) so you can tell whether a
  live-cluster value was ever declared in Git at all.
- Familiarity with the `Application` spec fields this skill diagnoses
  against — see
  [argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-application-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  for `syncPolicy`, `ignoreDifferences`, sync waves, and hooks if any of
  those concepts are unfamiliar; this skill does not re-explain them.
- For hook failures: `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) logs`/`[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) describe pod` access in the
  destination namespace to read the failing hook Job's actual pod
  output, not just Argo CD's summary status.

## Step-by-step guidance

1. **Start from the `Application`'s own status, not just the UI's
   red/yellow dot.** Pull the full status block for the actual sync/health
   condition and the specific resource(s) implicated:
   ```bash
   [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app get payments-api-prod -o json | jq '.status.sync, .status.health, .status.operationState'
   [kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get application payments-api-prod -n [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}'
   ```
   `status.sync.status` (`Synced`/`OutOfSync`), `status.health.status`
   (`Healthy`/`Progressing`/`Degraded`/`Missing`/`Unknown`), and
   `status.operationState.phase` (`Succeeded`/`Failed`/`Error`/`Running`)
   are three **independent** signals — a `Synced` + `Degraded`
   `Application` and an `OutOfSync` + `Healthy` one are different
   problems requiring different fixes, so don't collapse them into one
   "is it broken" question.

2. **Get the resource-level diff, not the app-level summary.** `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)
   app diff` shows exactly which fields differ, per resource, between
   the Git-rendered manifest and the live object:
   ```bash
   [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app diff payments-api-prod
   ```
   Read the diff output as `< live cluster` / `> Git desired` (or the
   reverse depending on CLI version — confirm with `--help` if unsure).
   A diff limited to one or two fields on one resource (e.g. `replicas`,
   an injected annotation) is a very different problem from a diff
   spanning many resources (usually a bad merge, a botched [Kustomize](../kustomize/SKILL.md)
   overlay, or the wrong `targetRevision`).

3. **Narrow to the specific resource when the app has many.** `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)
   app resources` lists every managed resource with its own sync/health
   status so you're not diffing the whole app to find one bad
   Deployment:
   ```bash
   [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app resources payments-api-prod
   [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app diff payments-api-prod --resource apps:Deployment:payments-prod/payments-api
   ```

4. **Distinguish manual drift from genuine Git/cluster divergence** —
   this is the crux of most confusing `OutOfSync` reports:
   - Check whether the differing field is **declared in Git at all**:
     `git show <targetRevision>:<path>` (or `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app manifests
     payments-api-prod` for the fully-rendered desired state). If the
     field isn't in the Git-rendered manifest, its live value came from
     somewhere else — a mutating webhook, an HPA, a defaulting
     controller, or a manual edit — not from Git diverging.
   - If the field *is* in Git and the live value differs, check
     `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get <resource> -o yaml` for
     `metadata.managedFields` (`[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get deploy payments-api -n
     payments-prod --show-managed-fields -o yaml`) to see which field
     manager last wrote that field and when — `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-controller` means
     Argo CD itself made the last write (so the diff is likely transient
     or a race), while `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md)-edit`/`[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md)-patch`/a human's kubeconfig
     user means someone changed it out-of-band.
   - Cross-check `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app history payments-api-prod` against the
     timing of the suspected manual change — if the last successful sync
     predates when the manual edit was made, the live cluster and the
     sync history simply haven't caught up yet; that's expected, not a
     bug.
   - If `selfHeal` is enabled and the field still shows as different
     *after* a completed sync, the manual edit is being fought and
     re-applied continuously — that's the sync-loop pitfall, and the fix
     is `ignoreDifferences`, not disabling `selfHeal` (see
     [argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-application-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
     Common pitfalls).

5. **Investigate a stuck/failing sync hook by going straight to the
   hook's own Job/Pod, not the Application's summary.** Argo CD's
   `operationState` reports which hook is blocking, but the actual error
   is in the pod:
   ```bash
   [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app get payments-api-prod -o json | jq '.status.operationState.syncResult.resources[] | select(.hookType != null)'
   [kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get jobs -n payments-prod -l [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md).argoproj.io/hook-type
   [kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) logs job/payments-api-migrate -n payments-prod
   [kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) describe pod -l job-name=payments-api-migrate -n payments-prod
   ```
   Common root causes at this point: the hook container's command
   exited non-zero (application-level bug in the migration/script — read
   the actual log line), the pod never scheduled (resource
   requests/limits or a missing image pull secret — check `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md)
   describe pod` events), or the hook Job hit its own `activeDeadlineSeconds`
   / Argo CD's operation timeout before finishing.

6. **If a hook is stuck because a previous failed run's Job object still
   exists**, confirm the `hook-delete-policy` and clean up manually if
   needed rather than waiting indefinitely:
   ```bash
   [kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get jobs -n payments-prod -l [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md).argoproj.io/hook-type=PreSync
   [kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) delete job payments-api-migrate -n payments-prod   # only if hook-delete-policy is missing/insufficient
   [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app sync payments-api-prod
   ```
   Prefer fixing `hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded,HookFailed` in Git
   (see
   [argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-application-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md))
   over repeatedly deleting stuck Jobs by hand — the manual delete is a
   one-time unblock, not a fix for the recurring cause.

7. **When a `Degraded`/stuck `Progressing` resource is a custom CRD**,
   confirm whether Argo CD has real health-check logic for that kind
   before trusting its verdict:
   ```bash
   [kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get application payments-api-prod -n [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) -o jsonpath='{.status.resources[?(@.kind=="DatabaseClaim")]}'
   [kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get databaseclaim payments-api-db -n payments-prod -o yaml
   ```
   If `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md)` shows the resource genuinely healthy but Argo CD reports
   `Progressing`/`Unknown` indefinitely, this is a missing custom health
   check, not a real problem with the resource — see
   [argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-application-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
   step 5 for adding one, rather than treating the app as actually
   broken.

8. **Before forcing a resolution, run a dry-run to see exactly what a
   real sync would change:**
   ```bash
   [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app sync payments-api-prod --dry-run
   [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app sync payments-api-prod --resource apps:Deployment:payments-prod/payments-api --dry-run
   ```
   Only escalate to `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app sync --force` (replace semantics) or
   `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app terminate-op` (abort a stuck operation) once the dry-run
   diff and the hook logs make the root cause unambiguous — both are
   stronger, riskier actions than a normal sync (see Common pitfalls).

## Best practices

- Always check `status.sync`, `status.health`, and
  `status.operationState` as three separate signals before deciding what
  "broken" means for a given `Application` — conflating them leads to
  fixing the wrong thing.
- Diff at the resource level (`[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app diff --resource ...`) as soon
  as an app manages more than a handful of resources — an app-wide diff
  on a large `Application` buries the one relevant field in noise.
- Treat `managedFields`/field-manager inspection as the standard way to
  tell "Argo CD wrote this last" from "a human/other controller wrote
  this last" — don't guess based on how the diff *looks*.
- Fix recurring manual-drift fields with `ignoreDifferences` (if the
  field is legitimately externally managed) or a written [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) telling
  humans to change it in Git, not `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md)`, going forward — treat
  repeated manual drift on the same field as a process gap, not a
  one-off to silently re-sync away each time.
- Read the hook's actual pod logs before assuming a hook "just needs a
  retry" — a hook Job that fails the same way every time has a real bug,
  and re-running it without a fix just delays the same failure.
- Prefer `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app sync --dry-run` and `--resource`-scoped syncs over a
  full `--force` sync when the cause is still unclear — narrow the blast
  radius while you're still diagnosing, not after.
- Keep a lightweight [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) note (which resource, what the diff showed,
  what was manually changed, what fix was applied) for any drift [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md)
  involving a manual out-of-band edit — repeated manual edits to the same
  resource are a signal worth raising with
  [incident-investigation-using-metrics-logs-traces](../../../[observability](../../Observability_and_SecOps/observability/SKILL.md)-and-platform-extras/skills/[incident-investigation-using-metrics-logs-traces](../../Observability_and_SecOps/[incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md)-investigation-using-metrics-logs-traces/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)-style
  root-cause tracking if they correlate with incidents.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app diff` shows no meaningful difference, yet the
  `Application` still reports `OutOfSync`.
  **Fix:** The diff is likely in a field Argo CD compares but doesn't
  render clearly in the default diff view (e.g. an annotation ordering
  difference, or a field under a `status` subresource being compared when
  it shouldn't be). Run `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app diff --hard-refresh` to bypass any
  cached comparison and force a fresh live-state fetch before concluding
  the diff tool itself is wrong.

- **Symptom:** A resource keeps flipping between `Synced` and `OutOfSync`
  every reconciliation loop, and each `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app diff` shows the same
  field toggling.
  **Fix:** This is a live sync loop, not intermittent drift — a mutating
  admission webhook, HPA, or defaulting controller is rewriting the field
  immediately after every sync (`selfHeal` reverts it, the controller sets
  it again). Confirm via `managedFields` timestamps, then add the field
  to `spec.ignoreDifferences` (see
  [argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-application-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md))
  instead of repeatedly re-syncing.

- **Symptom:** A `PreSync` hook Job is stuck `Running` far past when it
  should have finished, and the sync operation itself is stuck
  `Running`/never times out.
  **Fix:** Check `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) describe pod` for the hook — a common cause is
  the pod never actually scheduled (insufficient node resources, a
  missing/misconfigured image pull secret) so there's no process to time
  out yet. Argo CD's operation-level timeout doesn't fire on a pod that
  never started; fix the scheduling blocker directly, or set
  `activeDeadlineSeconds` on the hook Job spec so it self-terminates
  instead of hanging indefinitely.

- **Symptom:** Someone `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) scale`d a Deployment's replicas up during
  an [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md), and thirty seconds later it silently reverted back to the
  Git-declared value — the on-call engineer assumes Argo CD is
  "fighting" them and disables sync entirely as a workaround.
  **Fix:** This is `selfHeal` working as designed, not a bug — the
  replica count is declared in Git and Argo CD is correctly reverting
  the out-of-band change. During an active [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) where a temporary
  manual scale is intentional, either pause automated sync for that
  specific `Application` (`[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app set <app> --sync-policy none`) or
  add a temporary `Prune=false`/`ignoreDifferences` entry, and revert the
  workaround once the [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) resolves — don't leave sync disabled
  indefinitely as the "fix."

- **Symptom:** `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app sync --force` was used to unblock a stuck sync,
  and it deleted and recreated a resource with an immutable field
  (`ClusterIP`, a PVC's storage class), causing unexpected downstream
  breakage.
  **Fix:** `--force` uses replace (delete+create), not patch, semantics —
  reserve it for genuine "the API server rejects a normal patch" cases
  confirmed via the actual error in `operationState.message`, run
  `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app diff` first to see what would be replaced, and prefer
  `--resource`-scoped `--force` over an app-wide one so only the resource
  that genuinely needs replacing is affected.

- **Symptom:** A stuck sync operation is aborted with `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app
  terminate-op`, but some resources from the partial sync were already
  applied and others weren't, leaving the cluster in a half-migrated
  state.
  **Fix:** `terminate-op` stops the *operation*, not the already-applied
  changes — after terminating, immediately run `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app diff` to see
  exactly which resources are now inconsistent, and re-sync deliberately
  (ideally `--dry-run` first) rather than assuming termination reverted
  anything.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** `payments-api-prod` has shown `OutOfSync` for two days.
The team assumed it was "just a flaky sync" and kept clicking "Sync" in
the UI, which briefly clears the status before it returns within
minutes.

1. Pull the three independent status signals:
   ```bash
   [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app get payments-api-prod -o json | jq '.status.sync.status, .status.health.status, .status.operationState.phase'
   ```
   Result: `"OutOfSync"`, `"Healthy"`, `"Succeeded"` — the app is
   functionally fine (healthy), it's specifically the Git/cluster
   comparison that's mismatched, and the last sync operation itself
   completed without error. This rules out a hook failure entirely.

2. Get the resource-level diff:
   ```bash
   [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app diff payments-api-prod
   ```
   Output shows a single difference on the `payments-api` Deployment:
   `spec.replicas: live=12, git=3`.

3. Check whether `replicas` is even meaningfully declared in Git as `3`,
   or whether an HPA manages it:
   ```bash
   [kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get hpa payments-api -n payments-prod -o yaml
   ```
   Confirms an HPA (`payments-api-hpa`) targets this Deployment and had
   scaled it to 12 replicas under load — `replicas` in Git is just the
   HPA's minimum floor, not the live intended value, so this was never
   real drift; it's the well-known HPA-vs-[GitOps](../gitops/SKILL.md) interaction.

4. Fix at the source rather than re-syncing daily: add `replicas` to
   `ignoreDifferences` in the `Application` spec (per
   [argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-application-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)):
   ```yaml
   spec:
     ignoreDifferences:
       - group: apps
         kind: Deployment
         name: payments-api
         jsonPointers:
           - /spec/replicas
   ```
   After applying, `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app get payments-api-prod` reports `Synced`
   permanently (barring an actual Git change), and the team stops
   manually re-syncing an app that was never actually out of sync in any
   meaningful way.
