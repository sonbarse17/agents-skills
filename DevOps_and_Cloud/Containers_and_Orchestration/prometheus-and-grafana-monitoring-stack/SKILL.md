# Prometheus and Grafana [Monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md) Stack

## Purpose

Prometheus and Grafana are the de facto open-source metrics stack for
[Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md) and cloud-native workloads: Prometheus pulls (scrapes) metrics
on an interval, evaluates [alerting](../../Observability_and_SecOps/alerting/SKILL.md) rules against them, and hands firing
alerts to Alertmanager for routing/deduplication/silencing, while Grafana
turns the same time-series data into [dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md). The stack is simple to
install (kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart is a one-command bootstrap) but
easy to run badly: scrape configs that silently miss targets, PromQL
queries that are technically valid but semantically wrong (rate() over
too short a window, missing `by()` clauses that collapse [dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md) to a
single line), [alerting](../../Observability_and_SecOps/alerting/SKILL.md) rules that page on transient blips, and
hand-edited Grafana [dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md) that drift from what's checked into git.
This skill covers configuring scrape targets and service discovery
correctly, writing PromQL that means what you think it means, defining
[alerting](../../Observability_and_SecOps/alerting/SKILL.md) rules and Alertmanager routing that produce actionable pages
instead of noise, and provisioning Grafana as code so [dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md) survive
a cluster rebuild.

## When to use

- Onboarding a new service/exporter so its metrics are actually scraped
  (adding a `ServiceMonitor`/`PodMonitor`, a static scrape config, or a
  Prometheus Operator CRD).
- Writing or debugging a PromQL query for a dashboard panel, a
  recording rule, or an [alerting](../../Observability_and_SecOps/alerting/SKILL.md) rule.
- Defining or tuning Prometheus [alerting](../../Observability_and_SecOps/alerting/SKILL.md) rules and Alertmanager
  routing trees, grouping, inhibition, and silences.
- Provisioning Grafana datasources and [dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md) declaratively
  (as ConfigMaps/sidecars, Grafana provisioning YAML, or Terraform) so
  they are version-controlled rather than edited by hand in the UI.
- Investigating a target showing `up == 0` in Prometheus, a dashboard
  panel showing "No data", or an alert that fired but didn't page
  anyone (or paged everyone, repeatedly).
- Reducing alert fatigue — too many pages, duplicate pages across
  teams, or alerts with no clear owner/[runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md).

## Prerequisites & environment

- [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md) cluster with the **kube-prometheus-stack** Helm chart
  (bundles Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, and
  the `node-exporter`/`kube-state-metrics` exporters) — version 55.x+
  tracks Prometheus 2.5x and Grafana 10.x/11.x at the time of writing;
  pin an exact chart version rather than tracking `latest` in
  production.
- Familiarity with the Prometheus Operator custom resources
  (`ServiceMonitor`, `PodMonitor`, `PrometheusRule`, `Probe`) if running
  on top of the Operator, versus hand-written `scrape_configs` in
  `prometheus.yml` if running vanilla Prometheus.
- Cluster RBAC allowing Prometheus's service account to `list`/`watch`
  `Endpoints`, `Service`, and `Pod` objects for [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md) service
  discovery (`kubernetes_sd_configs`) to function.
- A notification receiver already provisioned for Alertmanager
  (Slack webhook, PagerDuty integration key, Opsgenie API key, or
  generic webhook) stored as a [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md) `Secret` — never inline in the
  Alertmanager config.
- For Grafana provisioning as code: either the sidecar pattern
  (ConfigMaps labeled `grafana_dashboard: "1"` auto-loaded by a
  Grafana sidecar container) or the Grafana provisioning
  directory/Terraform provider, plus a git repo to store dashboard JSON.

## Step-by-step guidance

1. **Install the stack with an explicit, pinned chart version:**
   ```bash
   helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.[github](../../CI_CD/github/SKILL.md).io/[helm-charts](../helm-charts/SKILL.md)
   helm upgrade --install kube-prom-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
     --namespace [monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md) --create-namespace \
     --version 65.5.0 \
     -f values-[monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md).yaml
   ```

2. **Add a scrape target for a new service.** Prefer the Prometheus
   Operator `ServiceMonitor` CRD over hand-editing `scrape_configs` —
   it's picked up automatically without a Prometheus reload/restart:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: [monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md).coreos.com/v1
   kind: ServiceMonitor
   metadata:
     name: payments-api
     namespace: [monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md)
     labels:
       release: kube-prom-stack   # must match the Prometheus CR's serviceMonitorSelector
   spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: payments-api        # matches the target Service's labels
     namespaceSelector:
       matchNames:
         - payments
     endpoints:
       - port: metrics            # named port on the Service, not a raw port number
         path: /metrics
         interval: 30s
         scrapeTimeout: 10s
   ```
   For non-[Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md) targets (a VM, an on-prem host), use a static
   `scrape_configs` entry or `file_sd_configs` pointing at a JSON/YAML
   file so targets can be added without restarting Prometheus:
   ```yaml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'onprem-node-exporter'
       file_sd_configs:
         - files: ['/etc/prometheus/file_sd/onprem-nodes.json']
           refresh_interval: 5m
   ```

3. **Confirm the target is actually being scraped** before writing any
   dashboard or alert against it: check `Status > Targets` in the
   Prometheus UI (or `up{job="payments-api"}`) — a target that never
   appears usually means a label-selector mismatch, not a scrape
   failure (see Common pitfalls).

4. **Write PromQL against a rate, not a raw counter**, for anything
   that is a `_total` counter metric:
   ```promql
   # request rate over 5m, per service and status code
   sum by (service, status_code) (
     rate(http_requests_total[5m])
   )

   # error ratio (%) — guard the denominator so it doesn't divide by zero
   100 * sum(rate(http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m]))
       / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))

   # p99 latency from a histogram
   histogram_quantile(0.99,
     sum by (le, service) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
   )
   ```
   Use a rate window at least **4x the scrape interval** (e.g. `[5m]`
   for a 30s-60s scrape interval) so `rate()` always has enough samples
   to extrapolate correctly.

5. **Add recording rules for anything queried repeatedly** ([dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md),
   alerts) to precompute expensive aggregations rather than recomputing
   them on every dashboard refresh:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: [monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md).coreos.com/v1
   kind: PrometheusRule
   metadata:
     name: payments-api-recording-rules
     namespace: [monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md)
     labels:
       release: kube-prom-stack
   spec:
     groups:
       - name: payments-api.rules
         interval: 30s
         rules:
           - record: job:http_requests:rate5m
             expr: sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
   ```

6. **Write [alerting](../../Observability_and_SecOps/alerting/SKILL.md) rules with a `for:` duration** to suppress
   flapping/transient blips, and attach severity + [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) labels so
   routing and on-call response are automatic:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: [monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md).coreos.com/v1
   kind: PrometheusRule
   metadata:
     name: payments-api-alerts
     namespace: [monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md)
     labels:
       release: kube-prom-stack
   spec:
     groups:
       - name: payments-api.alerts
         rules:
           - alert: PaymentsAPIHighErrorRate
             expr: |
               100 * sum(rate(http_requests_total{job="payments-api",status_code=~"5.."}[5m]))
                   / sum(rate(http_requests_total{job="payments-api"}[5m])) > 5
             for: 10m
             labels:
               severity: critical
               team: payments
             annotations:
               summary: "Payments API error rate above 5% for 10m"
               runbook_url: "https://[runbooks](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbooks/SKILL.md).internal/payments-api-error-rate"

           - alert: PrometheusTargetDown
             expr: up{job="payments-api"} == 0
             for: 5m
             labels:
               severity: warning
               team: payments
             annotations:
               summary: "Payments API target down for 5m"
   ```

7. **Configure Alertmanager routing** so alerts reach the right team
   without duplicate pages, using label matching, grouping, and
   inhibition:
   ```yaml
   route:
     receiver: default-slack
     group_by: ['alertname', 'team']
     group_wait: 30s
     group_interval: 5m
     repeat_interval: 4h
     routes:
       - matchers:
           - severity = "critical"
           - team = "payments"
         receiver: payments-pagerduty
         continue: false
       - matchers:
           - severity = "warning"
         receiver: default-slack

   inhibit_rules:
     # a firing critical alert suppresses a lower-severity alert for the same target
     - source_matchers: [severity = "critical"]
       target_matchers: [severity = "warning"]
       equal: ['alertname', 'job']

   receivers:
     - name: default-slack
       slack_configs:
         - api_url: '${SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}'
           channel: '#alerts-platform'
     - name: payments-pagerduty
       pagerduty_configs:
         - routing_key: '${PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY}'
   ```
   Store `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`/`PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY` in a [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md)
   `Secret` referenced via `alertmanagerConfigSecret`/`envFrom`, never
   inline.

8. **Provision Grafana datasources and [dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md) as code**, not
   through the UI, using the sidecar pattern:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: payments-api-dashboard
     namespace: [monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md)
     labels:
       grafana_dashboard: "1"   # auto-discovered by the Grafana sidecar
   data:
     payments-api.json: |
       { "title": "Payments API", "panels": [ ... ] }
   ```
   and a datasource provisioned once at install time:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: 1
   datasources:
     - name: Prometheus
       type: prometheus
       access: proxy
       url: http://kube-prom-stack-prometheus.[monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md):9090
       isDefault: true
       jsonData:
         timeInterval: 30s
   ```
   Export dashboard JSON from the Grafana UI only as a starting point,
   then check it into git and let the sidecar/provisioning pipeline own
   it going forward.

9. **Validate rule syntax before applying** with `promtool` in CI:
   ```bash
   promtool check rules payments-api-alerts.yaml
   promtool test rules payments-api-alerts_test.yaml
   ```

## Best practices

- **Use `ServiceMonitor`/`PodMonitor` CRDs over hand-edited
  `scrape_configs`** when running the Prometheus Operator — they're
  reconciled automatically and don't require a Prometheus restart/reload.
- **Every alert must have `severity` and `team` (or equivalent
  ownership) labels** and a `runbook_url` annotation — an alert with no
  clear owner and no [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) is a page nobody knows how to act on.
- **Set `for:` on every [alerting](../../Observability_and_SecOps/alerting/SKILL.md) rule** long enough to ride out normal
  noise (typically 5-15 minutes for error-rate/latency alerts, shorter
  for hard down/crash-loop conditions) — alerts without a `for:` fire on
  a single bad scrape.
- **Precompute expensive/frequently-used aggregations as recording
  rules** rather than repeating heavy PromQL in every dashboard panel —
  keeps dashboard load fast and query cost predictable.
- **Alert on symptoms (error rate, latency, saturation), not on every
  possible cause** — a smaller set of well-tuned symptom-based alerts
  produces far less noise than [alerting](../../Observability_and_SecOps/alerting/SKILL.md) on every internal metric.
- **Use inhibition rules to suppress redundant lower-severity alerts**
  when a related critical alert is already firing for the same target,
  instead of paging on every layer of a cascading failure.
- **Set retention and remote-write/long-term-storage deliberately** —
  local Prometheus TSDB retention (commonly 15-30 days) is for
  operational queries; use Thanos, Cortex, or Mimir (or a managed
  remote-write target) if you need long-term retention for [capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Cloud_Providers/azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  planning or compliance.
- **Version-control Grafana [dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md) and Alertmanager config** in the
  same repo/pipeline as the rest of the platform config — [dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md)
  edited only in the UI are lost on the next cluster rebuild.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** A `ServiceMonitor` is applied but the target never shows
  up under `Status > Targets` in Prometheus.
  **Fix:** The `ServiceMonitor`'s `labels` don't match the Prometheus
  custom resource's `serviceMonitorSelector` (commonly `release:
  <helm-release-name>`), or the `endpoints.port` name doesn't match a
  named port on the target `Service`. Check
  `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get prometheus -o yaml` for the selector and confirm the
  Service exposes a **named** port, not just a numeric one.

- **Symptom:** A dashboard panel using `rate(http_requests_total[1m])`
  shows a flat line or gaps even though traffic is steady.
  **Fix:** The rate window is too close to (or shorter than) the scrape
  interval, so `rate()` doesn't have enough samples to extrapolate.
  Use a window at least 4x the scrape interval (`[5m]` for a 30-60s
  scrape interval).

- **Symptom:** An alert fires and pages on-call, but investigation shows
  it was a single transient blip that self-resolved seconds later.
  **Fix:** No `for:` duration was set (or it was too short). Add a
  `for:` clause matched to the metric's natural noise level so the
  condition must hold for the full duration before firing.

- **Symptom:** The same underlying [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) produces five separate
  pages across four different teams within two minutes.
  **Fix:** No `inhibit_rules` or `group_by` tuning in Alertmanager — every
  downstream symptom alert fired independently. Group alerts by
  `alertname`/`team`/shared label, and add inhibition rules so a firing
  root-cause alert suppresses its known downstream symptoms.

- **Symptom:** A hand-edited Grafana dashboard that took hours to build
  disappears after a Helm upgrade or cluster rebuild.
  **Fix:** The dashboard was only ever saved through the Grafana UI,
  not provisioned via a ConfigMap/sidecar or the Terraform Grafana
  provider. Export it to JSON, check it into git, and load it through
  provisioning so it's rebuilt automatically.

- **Symptom:** Prometheus disk fills up and the pod starts
  crash-looping (`OOMKilled` or `no space left on device`).
  **Fix:** Retention (`--storage.tsdb.retention.time`/`.size`) wasn't
  bounded relative to actual disk size, or high-cardinality labels
  (e.g. a label containing a raw user ID or full URL path) blew up
  the number of time series. Bound retention explicitly, and [audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md)
  metrics/labels for unbounded cardinality before scraping them at
  scale.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** The `payments-api` team ships a new service. It exposes
Prometheus metrics on `/metrics` but is invisible in Prometheus, has no
dashboard, and no [alerting](../../Observability_and_SecOps/alerting/SKILL.md) — the team wants to be paged only on genuine
customer-impacting error rates, not on every blip.

1. Confirm the Service exposes a named metrics port:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: payments-api
     namespace: payments
     labels:
       app: payments-api
   spec:
     ports:
       - name: metrics
         port: 9100
         targetPort: 9100
   ```
2. Apply the `ServiceMonitor` (step 2 above) with `release:
   kube-prom-stack` matching the Prometheus selector, and confirm
   `up{job="payments-api"}` returns `1` in the Prometheus UI within one
   scrape interval.
3. Add a recording rule for request rate/error rate (step 5) so the
   dashboard and alert both reference the same precomputed series.
4. Add the `PaymentsAPIHighErrorRate` alert (step 6) with `for: 10m`,
   `severity: critical`, `team: payments`, and a `runbook_url`.
5. Route `severity="critical", team="payments"` to a PagerDuty
   receiver and everything else to the team's Slack channel (step 7),
   with an inhibition rule so a firing `PaymentsAPIHighErrorRate`
   suppresses the lower-severity `PrometheusTargetDown` warning for
   the same job if both trip during the same [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md).
6. Provision a Grafana dashboard (request rate, error rate, p99 latency
   panels backed by the recording rule and histogram query from step 4)
   as a labeled ConfigMap, checked into the team's platform-config repo
   alongside the `ServiceMonitor` and `PrometheusRule` manifests.
7. Run `promtool check rules` and `promtool test rules` in CI against
   the [alerting](../../Observability_and_SecOps/alerting/SKILL.md) rule file before merging, catching a typo'd metric name
   before it reaches production.
