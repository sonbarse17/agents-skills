# Complete [GitOps](../gitops/SKILL.md)/Argo CD Deployment On-Prem, From Scratch

## Purpose

The EKS/AKS/GKE variants of this skill all solve the same problem the same
way: a cloud-native workload identity federation mechanism (IRSA, Azure AD
Workload Identity, GKE Workload Identity Federation) lets Argo CD's own
components authenticate without a long-lived static credential. On a
self-managed or [bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md) cluster **that mechanism does not exist** —
there is no cloud STS to federate against. This is the genuine mechanical
difference this skill exists to cover: cluster access has to fall back to
[Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md)-native `ServiceAccount` tokens and RBAC, ideally made
short-lived via HashiCorp [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)'s [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md) secrets engine rather than a
permanent bearer token; private registry authentication needs an
explicit `imagePullSecret`/credential-helper flow instead of an IRSA/
Workload-Identity-backed pull; and the Ingress/TLS layer needs a
[bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md) load balancer (MetalLB) and often an internal CA instead of a
cloud LB and public ACME issuance. Everything else — the `Application`
spec, `ApplicationSet` generators, sync policy — is identical to the cloud
variants and is not repeated here.

## When to use

- Starting from a bare, already-provisioned self-managed [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md)
  cluster (kubeadm, k3s, Cluster API, or a vendor distribution) with
  nothing [GitOps](../gitops/SKILL.md)-related installed, needing a working Argo CD + first
  deployed app + multi-environment rollout by the end of the session, with
  no cloud provider IAM available.
- The user explicitly wants cluster-access credentials issued by [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)
  (short-lived) instead of a permanent [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md) Secret bearer token.
- Standing up a second/third on-prem environment (a separate physical
  cluster or air-gapped site) for a service already [GitOps](../gitops/SKILL.md)-managed
  elsewhere.
- Migrating a team off manual `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) apply`/`helm upgrade` deploys on
  on-prem infrastructure onto a full [GitOps](../gitops/SKILL.md) flow, starting from zero.
- Diagnosing why a freshly installed Argo CD on-prem can't pull a private
  registry image, can't reach a second physical cluster, or has no
  externally reachable Ingress.

## Prerequisites & environment

- A self-managed [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md) cluster already provisioned and reachable via
  `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md)` — [bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md)/VMware provisioning patterns are covered by
  [on-prem-infrastructure-patterns](../../../cloud/skills/[on-prem-infrastructure-patterns](../../Cloud_Providers/on-prem-infrastructure-patterns/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  and are not repeated here; this skill starts from "the cluster exists."
- `helm` ≥ 3.12, `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md)`, and cluster-admin access to create
  `ServiceAccount`s, `ClusterRole`s, and `ClusterRoleBinding`s.
- A [bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md) load balancer already installed —
  [metallb-[bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md)-load-balancer-configuration](../../../[kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[metallb-[bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md)-load-balancer-configuration](../metallb-[bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md)-load-balancer-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  — since there is no cloud `LoadBalancer` Service type to fall back on for
  Ingress.
- A private container registry (Harbor, Nexus, or similar) already
  reachable from the cluster, with credentials available.
- Optional but recommended for anything beyond a small/dev deployment: a
  running [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md) cluster — see
  [vault-operations-and-pki-engine-configuration](../../../[security-scanning](../../../Security/security-scanning/SKILL.md)-tooling/skills/[vault-operations-and-pki-engine-configuration](../[vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)-operations-and-pki-engine-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  for standing it up, and
  [secrets-management](../../../[devsecops](../../../Security/devsecops/SKILL.md)/skills/[secrets-management](../../Cloud_Providers/secrets-management/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  for the general dynamic-secrets pattern this skill applies specifically
  to Argo CD's cluster-access credentials.
- A Git repository already reachable from the cluster's network path
  (self-hosted Gitea/GitLab is common on-prem — see
  [gitea-actions-and-ci](../../../cicd-tooling/skills/[gitea-actions-and-ci](../../CI_CD/gitea-actions-and-ci/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  if the config repo also lives there).

## Step-by-step guidance

### Phase 0 — Confirm no externally-reachable LoadBalancer exists yet

```bash
[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get svc -A -o wide | grep LoadBalancer
```
On a fresh self-managed cluster this is normally empty — a `Service` of
type `LoadBalancer` stays `<pending>` forever without MetalLB (or an
equivalent) installed. Install MetalLB (Phase 3 depends on it) before
assuming any `LoadBalancer`-typed Service will ever get an external IP.

### Phase 1 — Install Argo CD via Helm

```bash
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.[github](../../CI_CD/github/SKILL.md).io/argo-helm
helm repo update
helm install [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) argo/[argo-cd](../argo-cd/SKILL.md) \
  --namespace [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) --create-namespace \
  --version 7.6.12 \
  --set server.service.type=ClusterIP
[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get pods -n [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)
```
Identical to the cloud variants — the install itself has no cloud
dependency.

### Phase 2 — Cluster access without cloud IAM: ServiceAccount + RBAC, optionally [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)-issued

There is no OIDC-federated STS token to lean on here, so cluster access
for any *additional* destination cluster (a second physical site) falls
back to [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md)-native credentials, scoped as narrowly as possible per
[gitops-multi-cluster-management](../[gitops-multi-cluster-management](../[gitops](../gitops/SKILL.md)-multi-cluster-management/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md):

```yaml
# Applied ON the spoke (second on-prem) cluster
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-manager
  namespace: kube-system
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-manager-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["apps", "", "batch", "networking.k8s.io"]
    resources: ["deployments", "services", "configmaps", "secrets", "jobs", "ingresses"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
    # Scoped to the resource kinds this spoke's workloads actually use —
    # not "*"/"*", since there is no cloud IAM boundary as a backstop.
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-manager-role-binding
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-manager
    namespace: kube-system
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-manager-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

The naive version of this uses the ServiceAccount's long-lived token
Secret directly in the hub's cluster registration `Secret` — functional,
but a permanent, non-rotating credential is exactly the failure mode
IRSA/Workload Identity exist to avoid on cloud. **Where the operational
maturity to run [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md) already exists, prefer short-lived, [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)-brokered
credentials instead**: configure [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)'s [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md) secrets engine (or a
scheduled rotation job) to periodically mint a fresh token for
`[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-manager` and update the hub's cluster `Secret` via an External
Secrets Operator sync rather than a token that's valid forever:
```bash
[vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md) write auth/[kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md)/config \
  kubernetes_host="https://<spoke-api-server>:6443"
[vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md) policy write [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-manager-policy - <<EOF
path "[kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md)/creds/[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-manager" { capabilities = ["read"] }
EOF
```
See
[vault-operations-and-pki-engine-configuration](../../../[security-scanning](../../../Security/security-scanning/SKILL.md)-tooling/skills/[vault-operations-and-pki-engine-configuration](../[vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)-operations-and-pki-engine-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
for standing up [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)'s PKI/auth engines, and
[sealed-secrets-and-external-secrets-operator](../../../[security-scanning](../../../Security/security-scanning/SKILL.md)-tooling/skills/[sealed-secrets-and-external-secrets-operator](../sealed-secrets-and-external-secrets-operator/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
for the `ExternalSecret` that syncs the [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)-issued credential into the
hub's `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)`-namespace cluster registration `Secret`.

### Phase 3 — Private registry auth and MetalLB-fronted Ingress/TLS

Unlike the cloud variants (IRSA/Workload-Identity-backed registry pulls),
on-prem private registry access is an explicit `imagePullSecret`, since
there is no cloud IAM-to-registry federation:
```bash
[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) create secret [docker](../docker/SKILL.md)-registry harbor-pull-secret \
  --[docker](../docker/SKILL.md)-server=harbor.internal.example.com \
  --[docker](../docker/SKILL.md)-username=[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-reader \
  --[docker](../docker/SKILL.md)-password="${HARBOR_ROBOT_TOKEN}" \
  -n [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)
```
Prefer a **Harbor robot account** (scoped to pull-only on specific
projects) over a personal account's credentials, and source
`HARBOR_ROBOT_TOKEN` from [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)/`[secrets-management](../../Cloud_Providers/secrets-management/SKILL.md)`, never hardcoded.

For Ingress, install
[metallb-[bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md)-load-balancer-configuration](../../../[kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[metallb-[bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md)-load-balancer-configuration](../metallb-[bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md)-load-balancer-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
first so `ingress-nginx`'s own Service can actually get an external IP,
then front `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-server` with
[ingress-nginx-configuration](../../../[kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[ingress-nginx-configuration](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Frontend/ingress-nginx-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).
TLS is the other on-prem-specific divergence: with no publicly resolvable
DNS name for an ACME HTTP-01/DNS-01 challenge, issue from an **internal CA**
via [cert-manager-tls-automation](../../../[kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[cert-manager-tls-automation](../cert-manager-tls-automation/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)'s
private-CA `Issuer` pattern (backed by [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)'s PKI engine, if available)
instead of Let's Encrypt:
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata: { name: internal-[vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)-ca }
spec:
  [vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md):
    server: https://[vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md).internal.example.com:8200
    path: pki_int/sign/[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)
    auth:
      [kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md):
        role: cert-manager
        mountPath: /v1/auth/[kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md)
```

### Phase 4 — First `Application`

Identical to the cloud variants — follow
[argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-application-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
in full:
```bash
[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) apply -f payments-api-staging-application.yaml
[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) login [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md).internal.example.com --sso
[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app sync payments-api-staging --dry-run
[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app sync payments-api-staging
```

### Phase 5 — `ApplicationSet` for multi-environment/multi-site rollout

Per [argocd-applicationset-patterns](../[argocd-applicationset-patterns](../[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-applicationset-patterns/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md);
if staging and prod are separate physical clusters/sites, use the Cluster
generator filtered by label, with each site's registration reusing the
ServiceAccount/RBAC (or [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)-brokered) pattern from Phase 2.

### Phase 6 — Sync policy and health checks, deliberately

Manual sync until the pipeline feeding the config repo is trusted, then
`automated` per environment, plus custom Lua health checks for any
internal CRDs — both per
[argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd-application-configuration](../[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-application-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

### Phase 7 — Verify end-to-end

```bash
[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) cluster list
[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app list
[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get secret harbor-pull-secret -n [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) -o jsonpath='{.data.\.dockerconfigjson}' | base64 -d
[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) get certificate -n [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-server-tls -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}'
```
Confirm the Harbor pull secret's embedded token is still valid (robot
tokens can expire independently of the [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md) Secret they're stored
in) and that the internal-CA certificate shows `Ready: True` before
trusting the Ingress is actually serving valid TLS.

## Best practices

- Treat a static ServiceAccount token used for cross-cluster registration
  as an interim state, not the end state — plan the [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)-brokered
  rotation path (Phase 2) before the fleet grows past a handful of
  clusters, since manually rotating tokens across many clusters doesn't
  scale and a leaked long-lived token has an unbounded blast radius.
- Scope the spoke `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-manager` `ClusterRole` to the exact resource
  kinds each spoke's workloads use — there is no cloud IAM boundary
  backstopping an overly broad on-prem RBAC grant the way there might be
  with a scoped IAM policy in the cloud variants.
- Use registry robot/service accounts (Harbor robot accounts, Nexus
  service users) scoped to pull-only on specific projects for
  `imagePullSecret`s, never a personal admin account's credentials.
- Install MetalLB and validate it hands out an external IP to a test
  `LoadBalancer` Service *before* installing `ingress-nginx` — debugging
  "Ingress isn't reachable" is much harder once both layers are stacked
  and unverified.
- Prefer an internal CA (via cert-manager's `ca`/`[vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)` Issuer types) over
  self-signed per-service certs for anything beyond a single throwaway
  test — an internal CA's trust bundle can be distributed once to clients,
  where self-signed certs require per-service trust exceptions.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** `ingress-nginx`'s own Service stays `<pending>` forever with
  no external IP, and every Ingress behind it is unreachable.
  **Fix:** This is expected without MetalLB (or an equivalent [bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md)
  LB) installed and configured with an IP address pool — install
  [metallb-[bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md)-load-balancer-configuration](../../../[kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[metallb-[bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md)-load-balancer-configuration](../metallb-[bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md)-load-balancer-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  and confirm a plain test `LoadBalancer` Service gets an IP before
  troubleshooting Ingress routing itself.

- **Symptom:** The cross-cluster `[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-manager` ServiceAccount token was
  copied once at spoke-registration time and, months later, cluster access
  from the hub silently fails after a spoke cluster's token-rotation
  policy (e.g. `--service-account-max-token-expiration`) invalidated it.
  **Fix:** A raw ServiceAccount token Secret does not auto-renew on
  clusters configured with bounded token lifetimes — either re-mint and
  update the hub's cluster `Secret` manually on a schedule, or migrate to
  the [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)-brokered rotation pattern in Phase 2 so renewal is automatic.

- **Symptom:** A Harbor `imagePullSecret` worked at initial setup and later
  every pod pull starts failing with `unauthorized` across the whole
  cluster simultaneously.
  **Fix:** Harbor robot account tokens have their own expiration
  independent of the [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/SKILL.md) Secret storing them — check the robot
  account's expiry in Harbor directly (`[docker](../docker/SKILL.md) login` manually against the
  registry with the same credential to confirm), not just the Secret's
  presence in the cluster.

- **Symptom:** The first `Application` was created with `automated:
  {prune: true, selfHeal: true}` immediately, and a bad initial manifest
  deleted an unrelated pre-existing resource in the target namespace.
  **Fix:** Same end-to-end sequencing pitfall as the cloud variants —
  always run the first sync manually with `--dry-run` (Phase 4) before
  enabling `automated` in a later, deliberate step (Phase 6).

- **Symptom:** cert-manager's internal-CA `ClusterIssuer` ([Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)-backed)
  issues certificates that browsers/clients reject as untrusted, even
  though `[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) describe certificate` shows `Ready: True`.
  **Fix:** `Ready: True` only confirms cert-manager successfully obtained
  a certificate from the configured issuer — it says nothing about
  whether *clients* trust that issuer's root. Distribute the internal CA's
  root certificate to client trust stores (or your org's device management
  baseline) separately; this is expected behavior for an internal CA, not
  a cert-manager misconfiguration.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** Stand up Argo CD from scratch on a self-managed `payments-prod`
kubeadm cluster with no cloud provider, using Harbor for private images,
[Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md) for both PKI and Argo CD's own cross-cluster credential rotation,
and MetalLB + Ingress for external access.

```bash
# Phase 0/3 — MetalLB first
helm install metallb metallb/metallb -n metallb-system --create-namespace
[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) apply -f metallb-ip-pool.yaml

# Phase 1
helm install [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) argo/[argo-cd](../argo-cd/SKILL.md) -n [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) --create-namespace --version 7.6.12

# Phase 2 — spoke ServiceAccount + RBAC (applied on payments-staging)
[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) apply -f [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-manager-rbac.yaml --context payments-staging

# Phase 3 — Harbor pull secret + internal-CA Ingress
[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) create secret [docker](../docker/SKILL.md)-registry harbor-pull-secret \
  --[docker](../docker/SKILL.md)-server=harbor.internal.example.com \
  --[docker](../docker/SKILL.md)-username=[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-reader --[docker](../docker/SKILL.md)-password="${HARBOR_ROBOT_TOKEN}" -n [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)
[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) apply -f [argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-server-ingress-internal-ca.yaml

# Phase 4 — first Application, manual sync
[kubectl](../kubectl/SKILL.md) apply -f payments-api-staging-application.yaml
[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app sync payments-api-staging --dry-run
[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md) app sync payments-api-staging
```
Phase 5 then replaces the single `Application` with a Cluster-generator
`ApplicationSet` selecting `tier: staging`/`tier: prod` labeled on-prem
clusters (full YAML in
[argocd-applicationset-patterns](../[argocd-applicationset-patterns](../[argocd](../argocd/SKILL.md)-applicationset-patterns/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)),
and Phase 6 promotes staging's sync policy to `automated` once verified —
identical decision structure to the cloud variants, just built on
ServiceAccount/RBAC and [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)-issued credentials instead of IRSA/Workload
Identity.
