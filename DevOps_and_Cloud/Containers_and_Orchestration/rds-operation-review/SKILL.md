# RDS / Aurora Operational Review

Conduct a comprehensive operational review of Amazon RDS instances and Amazon Aurora
clusters aligned with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)
and the [Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_BestPractices.html)
and [Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_BestPractices.html)
best-practices guides.

This skill uses the **AWS RDS, Aurora, CloudWatch, CloudWatch Logs, EC2, and Cost
Explorer APIs only** — no Kubernetes (`k8s`) or `eks` MCP tools. All data is
collected through native AWS APIs available to the DevOps Agent's primary cloud
source role.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when the user asks to:
- Review, audit, or assess RDS instances or Aurora clusters
- Check RDS / Aurora best-practices compliance
- Evaluate database security, cost, reliability, performance, or backups
- Perform an RDS / Aurora operational readiness review (ORR)
- Investigate database health or configuration drift

## Step 1: Identify Target Resources

Ask the user which databases to review. Accept:
- Specific instance / cluster identifiers and regions
- "all instances" / "all clusters" in specific regions
- "all RDS in all regions"

If no scope is given, default to all configured account regions.

## Step 2: Discover RDS / Aurora Resources

Per region (skip empty regions):

```
rds.DescribeDBInstances           # RDS instances + Aurora cluster member instances
rds.DescribeDBClusters            # Aurora clusters (skip if user said "Provisioned only")
rds.DescribeDBClusterEndpoints    # Aurora reader/writer endpoints
rds.DescribeGlobalClusters        # Aurora Global Database (cross-region)
rds.DescribeDBProxies             # RDS Proxy
```

Capture per resource:
- Engine, engineVersion, dbInstanceClass / serverlessV2 capacity
- Multi-AZ, AvailabilityZones, subnetGroup, VpcId
- AllocatedStorage, MaxAllocatedStorage, StorageType, Iops, StorageThroughput, StorageEncrypted, KmsKeyId
- BackupRetentionPeriod, PreferredBackupWindow, PreferredMaintenanceWindow, AutoMinorVersionUpgrade
- DeletionProtection, PubliclyAccessible, IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled
- PerformanceInsightsEnabled, PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod, MonitoringInterval (Enhanced Monitoring), MonitoringRoleArn
- EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports, AssociatedRoles
- ReadReplicaSourceDBInstanceIdentifier / ReadReplicaDBInstanceIdentifiers
- Tags (`rds.ListTagsForResource` — param name is `ResourceName` and value is the resource ARN)

## Step 3: Discover Configuration Dependencies

For each database, collect:

```
rds.DescribeDBParameterGroups           # custom vs default
rds.DescribeDBClusterParameterGroups    # Aurora
rds.DescribeOptionGroups                # RDS option groups
rds.DescribeDBSubnetGroups              # subnet AZ spread
ec2.DescribeSecurityGroups              # vpcSecurityGroupIds → ingress rules
kms.DescribeKey                         # for KmsKeyId (encryption at rest)
```

## Step 4: Collect Backups, Snapshots, Maintenance

```
rds.DescribeDBSnapshots                            # manual + automated, per instance
rds.DescribeDBClusterSnapshots                     # Aurora
rds.DescribeDBInstanceAutomatedBackups
rds.DescribeDBClusterAutomatedBackups
rds.DescribeDBEngineVersions                       # current vs latest minor/major
rds.DescribePendingMaintenanceActions
rds.DescribeEvents                                 # last 14 days; duration in MINUTES (20160)
rds.DescribeEventSubscriptions
```

For each instance/cluster, also fetch:
- `rds.DescribeDBLogFiles` — list of logs available locally on the DB
- `logs.DescribeLogGroups` with prefix:
  - Instances: `/aws/rds/instance/<dbInstanceIdentifier>/`
  - Aurora: `/aws/rds/cluster/<dbClusterIdentifier>/`

## Step 5: Collect CloudWatch Metrics (7-Day Historical)

**One** `cloudwatch.GetMetricData` call per resource. `Period: 21600` (6 hours).
`StartTime`: 7 days ago. `EndTime`: now.

### 5.1 RDS Instances (dimension `DBInstanceIdentifier`)

| id | metricName | stat | unit |
|----|------------|------|------|
| `cpu` | CPUUtilization | Average | % |
| `freeMem` | FreeableMemory | Minimum | bytes |
| `freeSpace` | FreeStorageSpace | Minimum | bytes |
| `readIops` | ReadIOPS | Average | count/s |
| `writeIops` | WriteIOPS | Average | count/s |
| `readLat` | ReadLatency | Average | s |
| `writeLat` | WriteLatency | Average | s |
| `dbConn` | DatabaseConnections | Maximum | count |
| `swap` | SwapUsage | Average | bytes |
| `netIn` | NetworkReceiveThroughput | Average | bytes/s |
| `netOut` | NetworkTransmitThroughput | Average | bytes/s |
| `binLog` | BinLogDiskUsage | Average | bytes |
| `replLag` | ReplicaLag | Maximum | s |

### 5.2 Aurora Clusters (dimension `DBClusterIdentifier`)

| id | metricName | stat | unit |
|----|------------|------|------|
| `cpu` | CPUUtilization | Average | % |
| `freeMem` | FreeableMemory | Minimum | bytes |
| `dbConn` | DatabaseConnections | Maximum | count |
| `replLag` | AuroraReplicaLag | Maximum | ms |
| `bufCache` | BufferCacheHitRatio | Average | % |
| `commitLat` | CommitLatency | Average | ms |
| `readLat` | ReadLatency | Average | s |
| `writeLat` | WriteLatency | Average | s |
| `volReadIops` | VolumeReadIOPs | Sum | count |
| `volWriteIops` | VolumeWriteIOPs | Sum | count |
| `serverlessAcu` | ServerlessDatabaseCapacity | Average | ACU |

### 5.3 Per-Instance Aurora Members

Same instance metrics as 5.1, dimensioned by `DBInstanceIdentifier` of each cluster member.

Fetch `cloudwatch.DescribeAlarmsForMetric` for the key metrics
(`CPUUtilization`, `FreeStorageSpace`, `DatabaseConnections`, `ReadLatency`,
`WriteLatency`, `ReplicaLag` / `AuroraReplicaLag`) per resource so the report can
flag missing alarms.

## Step 6: Collect Logs (7-Day)

Per database log group, scan with `logs.FilterLogEvents` for:

| Pattern | What it indicates |
|---------|-------------------|
| `ERROR` / `FATAL` | engine errors |
| `Out of memory` / `OOM` | memory pressure |
| `connection limit exceeded` / `too many connections` | connection saturation |
| `deadlock` / `lock wait timeout` | contention |
| `slow query` / `duration: ` (Postgres slow log) | query performance |
| `aborted connection` (MySQL) | client/network issues |
| `replication has stopped` / `IO_THREAD` errors | replication health |
| `checkpoint` warnings / `archiver failed` | I/O / WAL issues |
| `failed to connect` / `authentication failed` | auth/network |

Record occurrence counts per pattern over the 7-day window.

## Step 7: Collect CloudTrail-Visible RDS Events

Use `rds.DescribeEvents` (last 14 days) per resource — covers the same
operational signal as CloudTrail for RDS without an extra API permission.
Look for: `failover`, `restart`, `parameter group apply`, `out-of-memory`,
`storage-full`, `low-storage`, `automated-backup-failed`,
`maintenance`-related events, `read replica error`, `instance stopped`.

## Step 8: Cost Data

Once per review (not per resource):

```
costexplorer.GetCostAndUsage     # 3 months, by USAGE_TYPE,
                                 # filter Service = "Amazon Relational Database Service"
rds.DescribeReservedDBInstances  # RI inventory
```

Estimate per-database monthly cost as a proportional split of the latest month
total (Cost Explorer doesn't break down per DB):

1. Get the most recent full month total RDS spend.
2. Per resource, weight by `vCPUs(instance class) × (Multi-AZ ? 2 : 1) + allocatedStorageGB`.
3. For Aurora clusters, sum across cluster member instances; storage is cluster-shared.
4. Note the estimate in the report with an "estimated" badge.

## Step 9: Analyze Against Best Practices

Evaluate ALL collected data across the five Well-Architected pillars and assign a
severity to every finding: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or INFO.

### 9.1 Security
Ref: [Security in Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.html)

- **Network exposure**: `PubliclyAccessible=true` → CRITICAL for production. Security groups with `0.0.0.0/0` ingress on the DB port → CRITICAL.
- **Encryption at rest**: `StorageEncrypted=false` → HIGH (or CRITICAL for regulated workloads). Customer-managed KMS key preferred over AWS-managed.
- **Encryption in transit**: parameter `rds.force_ssl=1` (Postgres) / `require_secure_transport=ON` (MySQL/MariaDB) → MEDIUM if not set.
- **IAM auth**: `IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled=false` → MEDIUM. Master password in app code instead of Secrets Manager → HIGH.
- **Secrets Manager rotation**: not enabled → MEDIUM.
- **Audit logging**: engine audit logs not in `EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports` → MEDIUM (HIGH for PCI/HIPAA scope).
- **CMK rotation**: KMS key without automatic rotation → LOW.

### 9.2 Reliability
Ref: [High Availability for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html)

- **Multi-AZ**: production single-AZ → HIGH (Aurora: ≥1 reader in a different AZ).
- **Subnet group AZ spread**: subnets span <2 AZs → HIGH.
- **Backups**: `BackupRetentionPeriod=0` → CRITICAL. <7 days for production → HIGH.
- **Deletion protection**: production with `DeletionProtection=false` → HIGH.
- **Auto minor version upgrade**: `AutoMinorVersionUpgrade=false` for non-prod → MEDIUM.
- **Custom parameter group**: instance using `default.<engine>` parameter group → MEDIUM (can't tune).
- **Pending maintenance**: required actions not applied within window → MEDIUM, escalating with age.
- **Replication health (read replicas)**: `ReplicaLag` 7-day max > 30s → HIGH; > 300s → CRITICAL.
- **Aurora replicas**: clusters with no reader → MEDIUM; single-AZ readers → MEDIUM.
- **DR**: cross-region read replica or Aurora Global Database absent for tier-1 workloads → MEDIUM.

### 9.3 Performance
Ref: [DB Instance Performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Monitoring.html)

7-day metric thresholds (full table in `references/metrics-thresholds.md`):
- `CPUUtilization` avg > 70% → MEDIUM, > 90% → HIGH.
- `FreeStorageSpace` < 20% allocated → HIGH, < 10% → CRITICAL.
- `FreeableMemory` < 10% instance class memory → HIGH; sustained `SwapUsage` > 0 → MEDIUM.
- `DatabaseConnections` max > 80% of `max_connections` parameter → HIGH.
- `ReadLatency` / `WriteLatency` avg > 20ms (10ms for io1/io2) → MEDIUM.
- `BufferCacheHitRatio` (Aurora) < 95% → MEDIUM, < 90% → HIGH.
- `BinLogDiskUsage` growth without retention bounds → MEDIUM.
- **Performance Insights** disabled → MEDIUM (free 7-day tier should always be on).
- **Enhanced Monitoring** disabled or interval > 60s for production → MEDIUM.
- **Connection pooling**: high connection churn / no RDS Proxy → MEDIUM for serverless / many-client workloads.

### 9.4 Cost Optimization
Ref: [Cost-Optimized Architectures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_BestPractices.html#CHAP_BestPractices.Optimization)

- **Stopped instances**: `DBInstanceStatus=stopped` (still pays storage) → HIGH.
- **Previous-generation classes**: `db.m4 / db.r4 / db.t2` → MEDIUM.
- **gp2 → gp3**: any `StorageType=gp2` → MEDIUM (≈20% cheaper, equal/better performance).
- **Over-provisioned IOPS**: `io1`/`io2` with avg `IOPS used / IOPS provisioned < 50%` → MEDIUM.
- **Reserved Instance coverage**: production On-Demand without RIs → MEDIUM, with estimated savings.
- **Storage autoscaling**: `MaxAllocatedStorage` not set → LOW, increases stockout risk.
- **Idle databases**: `DatabaseConnections` 7-day max < 5 + `CPUUtilization` 7-day avg < 5% → MEDIUM (candidate to stop / delete).
- **Manual snapshots**: many > 90 days old → LOW (review retention).
- **Cost-allocation tags**: missing `Environment`, `Owner`, `CostCenter` → LOW.
- **Graviton migration**: x86 (`db.r5`, `db.m5`, `db.t3`) where Graviton is supported → MEDIUM (~20% saving).

### 9.5 Operational Excellence
Ref: [Monitoring Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Monitoring.html)

- **CloudWatch alarms**: missing alarms on `CPUUtilization`, `FreeStorageSpace`, `DatabaseConnections`, `FreeableMemory`, `ReplicaLag` → MEDIUM each.
- **Event subscriptions**: no `rds.DescribeEventSubscriptions` covering this resource → MEDIUM.
- **Engine version currency**: minor version not latest available → LOW; major version EOL/within 6 months → HIGH.
- **Log exports**: engine error / slow / audit logs not exported to CloudWatch → MEDIUM.
- **Maintenance window**: not configured / overlaps business hours → LOW.
- **Tagging**: missing operational tags (`Environment`, `Owner`, `Runbook`, `OnCall`) → LOW.
- **Drift**: parameters changed in default parameter group (impossible by design — use as a flag for non-default usage check).

## Step 10: Generate Report

Generate a separate shareable report artifact for **each resource** reviewed.

Artifact naming: `rds-review-<resource-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`
Example: `rds-review-prod-aurora-2026-04-29.md`

For each resource, create the artifact as a Markdown document with:

### Report Header
```
# RDS / Aurora Operational Review — <resource-name>
Account: <account-id> | Region: <region> | Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Engine: <engine> <engineVersion> | Class: <dbInstanceClass / serverlessV2 ACU> | Multi-AZ: <yes/no>
```

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Definition | SLA |
|----------|------------|-----|
| CRITICAL | Immediate risk to availability, security, or data integrity | Fix within 24–48 hours |
| HIGH | Significant gap that could lead to incidents | Fix within 1 week |
| MEDIUM | Notable improvement opportunity | Plan within 30 days |
| LOW | Minor optimization or hardening | Address when convenient |
| INFO | Observation, no action required | N/A |

## Engine-Specific Considerations

- **MySQL / MariaDB** — `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, `max_connections`, slow query log,
  binlog retention, deprecated `query_cache_type` on 8.0+.
- **PostgreSQL** — `shared_buffers`, `work_mem`, autovacuum, `pg_stat_statements`,
  `log_min_duration_statement`, replication slots.
- **Oracle** — BYOL tracking, SGA/PGA sizing, AWR, tablespace autoextend.
- **SQL Server** — tempdb file count (1 per vCPU up to 8), MAXDOP, cost threshold for
  parallelism, Always On AGs vs Multi-AZ.
- **Aurora** — Serverless v2 ACU floor/ceiling, Global Database for DR, fast clones,
  Backtrack (MySQL only), cluster cache management.

## Known API Quirks (recorded so the agent doesn't trip on them)

- `rds.ListTagsForResource` — parameter is `ResourceName`, **value is the resource ARN**.
- `rds.DescribeEvents` — `Duration` is in **minutes** (20160 = 14 days).
- `applicationautoscaling.DescribeScalableTargets` — `ServiceNamespace="rds"` covers Aurora replica autoscaling.
- `logs.DescribeLogGroups` prefix differs:
  - Instances: `/aws/rds/instance/<id>/`
  - Aurora clusters: `/aws/rds/cluster/<id>/`
- Some Aurora metrics are cluster-only (`AuroraReplicaLag`, `BufferCacheHitRatio`,
  `VolumeReadIOPs`), others are instance-only (`FreeableMemory`, `CPUUtilization` per
  member). Query the right dimension or both.
- `rds.DescribeDBSnapshots` requires pagination for accounts with many snapshots —
  use `MaxRecords` and `Marker`.

## Data Source Boundaries

This skill explicitly does **not** call:
- Kubernetes API / `k8s` MCP — RDS is fully managed; no cluster API exists.
- `eks` MCP — outside scope.
- Dante or any non-AWS scripts — keep the skill self-contained on the AWS DevOps Agent's primary cloud-source IAM role.

If a customer needs deeper SQL-level analysis (e.g. Performance Insights `db.load`
breakdowns, top SQL by wait event), call `pi.GetResourceMetrics` and
`pi.DescribeDimensionKeys` directly — both are in the same `rds` permission family
when Performance Insights is enabled.
