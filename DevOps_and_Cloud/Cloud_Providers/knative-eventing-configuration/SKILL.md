# Knative Eventing Configuration

## Purpose

Knative Eventing is a separate component from Knative Serving —
it's a CloudEvents-native publish/subscribe layer for routing events
between producers (Sources) and consumers (Services or other sinks)
through a **Broker**, with **Triggers** declaring filtered subscriptions,
rather than the request/response, scale-to-zero model covered in
[knative-[serverless](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/serverless/SKILL.md)-configuration](../[knative-[serverless](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/serverless/SKILL.md)-configuration](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/knative-[serverless](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/serverless/SKILL.md)-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).
Conflating the two is a common source of confusion: a Knative `Service`
still receiving events via a Trigger scales the same way as any other
Knative Service, but the routing, filtering, retry, and dead-lettering
semantics belong entirely to Eventing, not Serving. This skill covers
Brokers, Triggers, and Sources specifically.

## When to use

- Standing up event-driven communication between services where a
  direct HTTP call would create tight coupling.
- Wiring an event Source (PingSource, ApiServerSource, a custom
  Source, or a Kafka/cloud-provider source via an Eventing extension)
  to a Broker.
- Writing or debugging a Trigger's CloudEvents attribute filter that
  isn't matching events as expected.
- Configuring retry and dead-letter handling for events that fail
  delivery to a subscriber.
- Deciding whether a given integration should be direct HTTP (Knative
  Serving-to-Serving) or routed through Eventing's Broker/Trigger model.

## Prerequisites & environment

- Knative Eventing installed on the cluster (separate installation from
  Knative Serving — a cluster can run Serving without Eventing or vice
  versa), plus a Broker implementation (the in-memory "MTChannelBased"
  broker for simple cases, or a Kafka-backed broker for durability and
  higher throughput — check which is installed with
  `[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) get brokers.eventing.knative.dev -A -o wide` and confirm the
  backing implementation before assuming delivery guarantees).
- `[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md)` access to `brokers.eventing.knative.dev`,
  `triggers.eventing.knative.dev`, and the specific Source CRDs in use.
- Familiarity with the CloudEvents spec's core attributes (`type`,
  `source`, `subject`, `data`), since Trigger filters match on these
  attributes.
- A subscriber (Knative Service, or any addressable HTTP sink) already
  deployed and reachable before wiring a Trigger to it.

## Step-by-step guidance

1. **Create a Broker as the central event routing point** in a
   namespace, rather than wiring Sources directly to subscribers:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
   kind: Broker
   metadata:
     name: orders-broker
     namespace: prod
     annotations:
       eventing.knative.dev/broker.class: MTChannelBasedBroker
   ```
   Direct Source-to-sink wiring works for a single, simple integration
   but doesn't scale to multiple consumers of the same event stream —
   a Broker lets multiple Triggers subscribe to the same event flow
   independently.

2. **Wire an event Source to the Broker**, not directly to a consumer:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1
   kind: ApiServerSource
   metadata:
     name: order-pod-watcher
     namespace: prod
   spec:
     serviceAccountName: order-pod-watcher-sa
     mode: Resource
     resources:
       - apiVersion: v1
         kind: Event
     sink:
       ref:
         apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
         kind: Broker
         name: orders-broker
   ```
   For a simple recurring test/heartbeat event, `PingSource` is the
   built-in choice; for real business events, a custom Source (a small
   adapter service that receives or polls upstream events and emits
   CloudEvents to the Broker's ingress) or a maintained community Source
   (Kafka, cloud-provider event sources) is more typical.

3. **Declare Triggers with explicit CloudEvents attribute filters**, not
   a Trigger with no filter subscribing a consumer to every event on
   the Broker:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
   kind: Trigger
   metadata:
     name: order-created-to-fulfillment
     namespace: prod
   spec:
     broker: orders-broker
     filter:
       attributes:
         type: com.example.order.created
     subscriber:
       ref:
         apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
         kind: Service
         name: fulfillment-service
   ```
   A Trigger with no `filter` (or an overly broad one) delivers every
   event on the Broker to that subscriber, which both wastes the
   subscriber's [capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md) and couples it to event types it was never
   designed to handle.

4. **Configure delivery retry and dead-lettering per Trigger** so a
   subscriber outage or transient failure doesn't silently drop events:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
   kind: Trigger
   metadata:
     name: order-created-to-fulfillment
     namespace: prod
   spec:
     broker: orders-broker
     filter:
       attributes:
         type: com.example.order.created
     subscriber:
       ref:
         apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
         kind: Service
         name: fulfillment-service
     delivery:
       retry: 5
       backoffPolicy: exponential
       backoffDelay: PT0.5S
       deadLetterSink:
         ref:
           apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
           kind: Service
           name: order-events-dlq-handler
   ```
   Without a `deadLetterSink`, an event that exhausts its retries is
   dropped with no record — the same silent-data-loss risk as an async
   Lambda invocation with no Dead Letter Queue configured.

5. **Use multiple attribute filters (or `filters` with `all`/`any`, on
   Eventing versions that support the newer filter expression syntax)
   to narrow subscriptions precisely**, rather than one broad Trigger
   per consumer handling unrelated event types internally with an
   if/else — check the installed Eventing version's supported filter
   syntax (`spec.filter.attributes` is the long-standing form; newer
   `spec.filters` array-based expressions add `any`/`all`/`not`/`exists`
   matching where available) before assuming the newer syntax is
   supported.

6. **Validate Broker delivery guarantees match the workload's actual
   requirement.** The in-memory channel-based Broker is simpler to
   operate but doesn't persist events beyond its backing channel's
   retention; a Kafka-backed Broker gives durable, replayable delivery
   at the cost of running and operating Kafka. Pick deliberately based
   on whether losing in-flight events during a Broker component restart
   is acceptable for this workload.

## Best practices

- Route all cross-service event flows through a Broker/Trigger, not
  direct Source-to-sink wiring, once more than one consumer might ever
  need the same event stream — retrofitting a Broker in later is more
  disruptive than starting with one.
- Write specific, narrow Trigger filters per subscriber rather than one
  broad Trigger with internal branching logic — this keeps the routing
  topology visible in the [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md) resources themselves, not buried
  in application code.
- Always configure `delivery.deadLetterSink` on Triggers whose events
  matter (order processing, billing, anything with a compliance or
  financial impact) — an event silently dropped after exhausting
  retries is a data-loss [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md) waiting to be discovered.
- Choose the Broker backend (in-memory vs. Kafka-backed) based on
  actual durability requirements, not on whichever was easiest to
  install first — migrating Broker backends later means re-wiring
  every Trigger and Source pointed at it.
- Monitor Trigger-level delivery failure metrics (most Broker
  implementations expose these) as a first-class SLO, the same as any
  other asynchronous delivery path in the system.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** A Trigger's subscriber never receives any events, even
  though the Source and Broker both show as `Ready`.
  **Fix:** The Trigger's `filter.attributes` likely doesn't match the
  actual CloudEvents attributes the Source emits (a mismatched `type`
  string is the most common cause); inspect the raw event with
  `[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) logs` on the Broker's ingress or a debug subscriber with no
  filter, confirm the exact attribute values, then correct the
  Trigger's filter to match.

- **Symptom:** One misbehaving Source floods the Broker with events,
  and every subscriber sees degraded performance, not just the intended
  consumer.
  **Fix:** All Triggers on a shared Broker receive from the same event
  stream; add specific filters so unrelated subscribers aren't invoked
  at all for irrelevant event types, and consider a separate Broker per
  logical domain if one producer's volume is disproportionate to
  others sharing the same Broker.

- **Symptom:** Events related to a failed downstream call (subscriber
  temporarily down) simply disappear with no record after some time.
  **Fix:** No `deadLetterSink` was configured on the Trigger, so events
  that exhaust retries are dropped; add a `deadLetterSink` pointing to
  a handler (even a simple one that logs to durable storage) and
  alarm on messages arriving there.

- **Symptom:** A team assumes events sent to a Broker are durably
  persisted and can be replayed after an [incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md), but they're gone.
  **Fix:** The installed Broker implementation is the in-memory
  channel-based one, which doesn't guarantee durable replay across a
  channel component restart; if replay/durability is a real
  requirement, migrate to a Kafka-backed (or equivalent durable) Broker
  implementation rather than assuming all Broker classes behave the
  same.

- **Symptom:** A new Trigger is added for a new consumer, and an
  unrelated, already-working consumer starts receiving unexpected
  events too.
  **Fix:** The new Trigger's filter was left too broad (or omitted),
  causing it to match events also delivered to the existing consumer's
  own Trigger if their filters overlap unintentionally; [audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md) all
  Triggers on the shared Broker for filter overlap, not just the newly
  added one, when diagnosing unexpected delivery.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** An `order-created` event, published by the order service
directly to a Broker as a CloudEvent, needs to reach both a fulfillment
service and a separate analytics-ingestion service, with the
fulfillment path requiring reliable delivery (retry + dead-letter) and
the analytics path tolerating occasional drops.

Broker:
```yaml
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: orders-broker
  namespace: prod
```

Trigger for fulfillment (reliable delivery):
```yaml
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: order-created-to-fulfillment
  namespace: prod
spec:
  broker: orders-broker
  filter:
    attributes:
      type: com.example.order.created
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: fulfillment-service
  delivery:
    retry: 5
    backoffPolicy: exponential
    backoffDelay: PT0.5S
    deadLetterSink:
      ref:
        apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
        kind: Service
        name: order-events-dlq-handler
```

Trigger for analytics (best-effort, no dead-letter needed):
```yaml
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: order-created-to-analytics
  namespace: prod
spec:
  broker: orders-broker
  filter:
    attributes:
      type: com.example.order.created
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: analytics-ingest
  delivery:
    retry: 2
```
Both Triggers subscribe to the same `com.example.order.created` event
type on the same Broker independently — the order service publishes
once to the Broker's ingress with no knowledge of either consumer, and
each Trigger's own `delivery` policy reflects that consumer's actual
reliability requirement rather than a one-size-fits-all setting shared
across every subscriber.
