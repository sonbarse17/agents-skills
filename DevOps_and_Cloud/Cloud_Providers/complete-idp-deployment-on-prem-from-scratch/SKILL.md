# Complete IDP Deployment on Prem from Scratch

## Purpose

An on-prem Internal Developer Platform inverts almost every assumption
the four cloud-specific skills in this repo make: there is no landing
zone with account-vending guardrails, no managed [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md) control plane,
no managed database, and — if the environment is air-gapped or
network-restricted — no assumption of reachable public registries or SaaS
identity providers. What replaces those is self-managed infrastructure the
platform team is fully responsible for at every layer, and a self-service
model built around internal identity (LDAP/AD) and internal-only approval
rather than cloud IAM and cloud budget policy. [Multi-tenancy](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/multi-tenancy/SKILL.md) is treated as
a first-class design phase here, not a later add-on, because a shared
on-prem cluster has none of the cheap "just vend another account/
subscription/project" isolation the cloud variants can lean on.

## When to use

- Standing up a platform for regulated, disconnected, or otherwise
  cloud-averse environments where infrastructure must be fully
  self-hosted.
- Building an IDP for an air-gapped or low-connectivity site where image
  pulls, chart repositories, and package installs cannot assume live
  internet access.
- Migrating a self-hosted [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md) environment that already exists
  (kubeadm-provisioned, vSphere-hosted) toward a Backstage-based platform,
  rather than starting from a cloud landing zone.
- Designing strong team/tenant isolation on a single shared on-prem
  cluster where there's no cloud-account boundary to fall back on.
- Auditing an in-progress on-prem IDP build for a skipped etcd-backup
  step, an unmirrored image dependency, or a self-service flow that
  quietly assumed cloud IAM was available.

## Prerequisites & environment

- A virtualization baseline (vSphere, or [bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md) via PXE/MAAS) already
  standardized, with inventory-as-code (IPAM/DCIM) covering the nodes this
  cluster will run on.
- Enough physical/VM [capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md) provisioned with real lead time — unlike
  cloud, there's no on-demand node to add mid-[incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md); [capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)-plan with
  actual procurement/allocation lead time in mind.
- A private container registry (e.g., Harbor or an equivalent) reachable
  from every cluster node, pre-populated with mirrored copies of every
  base image, Helm chart, and CNCF tool image this build needs if the
  environment has no reliable outbound internet access.
- `[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md)`, `helm` ≥ 3.8, `etcdctl` matching the cluster's etcd version,
  and (if adopting Cluster API) `clusterctl`, all available from an
  internal tooling host or bastion — not assumed to be freely
  downloadable at deploy time in an air-gapped site.
- A Node.js/Yarn toolchain to build Backstage, with its own npm/yarn
  registry mirrored internally if public registry access isn't available.
- Existing internal identity (LDAP or Active Directory) the self-service
  layer and Backstage's own auth provider will bind to — there is no
  cloud IAM to substitute.
- A named approver reachable through whatever internal channel this site
  actually has (email, an internal ticketing system) — assume no Slack/
  SaaS notification channel is guaranteed reachable.

## Step-by-step guidance

**Phase 1 — On-prem infrastructure baseline.** Establish inventory-as-code
before touching hardware, choose and standardize the virtualization
platform (vSphere is the common baseline; [bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md) via PXE/MAAS/Redfish
is the alternative), automate provisioning rather than hand-installing
OSes, and decide the hybrid connectivity model back to any cloud
dependency that remains (even an air-gapped site sometimes needs a
one-way path for patches). See
[on-prem-infrastructure-patterns](../../../cloud/skills/[on-prem-infrastructure-patterns](../on-prem-infrastructure-patterns/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).
**This phase's [capacity-planning](../../Observability_and_SecOps/[capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)-planning/SKILL.md) step matters more here than in any other
variant** — under-provisioning discovered mid-build costs weeks of
procurement lead time, not a changed instance type.

**Phase 2 — Self-managed [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md) cluster via kubeadm/Cluster API, with
etcd health as an explicit ongoing concern.** Bootstrap the control plane
with `kubeadm init`, decide stacked vs. external etcd for the control-plane
HA model, and put a load balancer/VIP in front of the API server before
joining additional control-plane nodes. If lifecycle management
declaratively across many clusters/sites matters, layer Cluster API on
top. See
[kubernetes-cluster-provisioning-with-kubeadm-and-cluster-api](../../../[kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[kubernetes-cluster-provisioning-with-kubeadm-and-cluster-api](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/[kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)-cluster-provisioning-with-kubeadm-and-cluster-api/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).
Because this cluster's control plane has no managed-service SLA behind
it, treat etcd snapshot backups and quorum/health [monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md) as a
standing operational phase from day one, not an [incident-response](../../Observability_and_SecOps/[incident](../../Observability_and_SecOps/incident/SKILL.md)-response/SKILL.md)
afterthought — see
[etcd-backup-restore-and-cluster-health](../../../[kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[etcd-backup-restore-and-cluster-health](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/etcd-backup-restore-and-cluster-health/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).
This phase has no equivalent in the managed-cluster cloud variants, where
the cloud provider owns etcd entirely.

**Phase 3 — Private registry and image/chart mirroring.** Stand up (or
confirm) a private registry reachable from every node, expose it internally
via ingress-nginx with a TLS certificate issued from an internal CA rather
than public ACME — see
[ingress-nginx-configuration](../../../[kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[ingress-nginx-configuration](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Frontend/ingress-nginx-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
and
[cert-manager-tls-automation](../../../[kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[cert-manager-tls-automation](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/cert-manager-tls-automation/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
for the private-CA issuance path specifically — and mirror every image and
chart this build depends on (Backstage's own image, Postgres, any CNCF
add-on) before assuming Phase 4 can simply `helm install` against a public
chart repository. **If this site is genuinely air-gapped, treat any step
below that references a public registry, chart repo, or package index as
requiring its mirrored internal equivalent instead** — this is the single
biggest source of "works everywhere else, fails here" surprises in an
on-prem build.

**Phase 4 — Backstage on the cluster, backed by self-hosted [PostgreSQL](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Backend/postgresql/SKILL.md) on
in-cluster block storage.** Package Backstage as a Helm chart, deploy it
against a Postgres instance running in-cluster on Rook-Ceph or [Longhorn](../../Observability_and_SecOps/longhorn/SKILL.md)
block storage (Rook-Ceph if object/shared-filesystem storage is also
needed elsewhere on this cluster; [Longhorn](../../Observability_and_SecOps/longhorn/SKILL.md) if only replicated block
storage is required — see
[rook-ceph-storage-operations](../../../[kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[rook-ceph-storage-operations](../../Observability_and_SecOps/rook-ceph-storage-operations/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
and
[longhorn-storage-configuration](../../../[kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[longhorn-storage-configuration](../../Observability_and_SecOps/[longhorn](../../Observability_and_SecOps/longhorn/SKILL.md)-storage-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
for the tradeoff), and bind Backstage's own authentication to the site's
existing LDAP/AD rather than a cloud identity provider. Chart packaging
follows
[helm-chart-authoring](../../../[kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[helm-chart-authoring](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/helm-chart-authoring/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md);
custom backend/frontend logic (very likely needed here for an LDAP/AD auth
provider plugin) follows
[backstage-plugin-development](../[backstage-plugin-development](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Backend/backstage-plugin-development/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

**Phase 5 — Golden-path template built for internal-only tooling.**
Author a golden-path template whose CI pipeline targets internal,
self-hosted runners (not a SaaS CI service assuming outbound internet) and
whose Dockerfile's base images resolve against the Phase 3 private
registry by default. Tier by complexity, same as the cloud variants, but
document explicitly that every external dependency in the template must
resolve internally. See
[golden-path-template-design-for-developer-platforms](../[golden-path-template-design-for-developer-platforms](../../../Product_and_Business/golden-path-template-design-for-developer-platforms/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

**Phase 6 — Validate the golden path end-to-end, on internal
infrastructure only.** Run the scaffold-build-deploy-smoke-test-teardown
pipeline against an ephemeral namespace on this same on-prem cluster (there
is no separate cloud preview environment to spin up on demand), and
confirm the pipeline itself has no accidental outbound dependency that
would fail in the air-gapped case even if it passes in a connected test
run. See
[golden-path-template-validation-and-testing](../[golden-path-template-validation-and-testing](../../CI_CD/golden-path-template-validation-and-testing/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

**Phase 7 — Internal-only self-service, gated by LDAP/AD identity rather
than cloud IAM.** Build Scaffolder actions that provision by calling
internal APIs — a vSphere API call to clone a VM template, an internal
IPAM/DCIM system for address allocation, or a Crossplane provider targeting
on-prem infrastructure if one is available — with approval routed to a
named internal approver reachable through whatever notification channel
this site actually guarantees. There is no cloud budget-policy layer to
lean on, so cost/[capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md) guardrails here are about physical
[capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md) headroom (see Phase 1) rather than a per-instance-class dollar
estimate. Keep the same state-machine and server-side-gate pattern as the
cloud variants. See
[platform-self-service-api-and-workflow-design](../[platform-self-service-api-and-workflow-design](../../../Product_and_Business/platform-self-service-api-and-workflow-design/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

**Phase 8 — [Multi-tenancy](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/multi-tenancy/SKILL.md) and team workspace design, front and center.**
Because this cluster has no cheap cloud-account-per-team escape hatch,
decide the tenancy model deliberately before onboarding a second team:
namespace-per-team with RBAC, ResourceQuotas, and default-deny
NetworkPolicies is the realistic default; dedicated clusters per tenant
are usually not affordable on-prem the way spinning up another cloud
account is. Route any dedicated-infrastructure request through an
explicit exception process rather than ad hoc. Treat this as a phase to
get right before Phase 7's self-service goes live broadly, not after. See
[multi-tenancy-and-team-workspace-design-for-idp](../[multi-tenancy-and-team-workspace-design-for-idp](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/[multi-tenancy](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/multi-tenancy/SKILL.md)-and-team-workspace-design-for-idp/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

**Phase 9 — Scorecards, rollout, and operating model.** Define
production-readiness checks appropriate to self-hosted infrastructure (is
the service's image pulled from the internal registry rather than a public
one directly, does it have a NetworkPolicy, is it registered with an
on-call rotation reachable internally), sequence rollout from a real pilot
team, and size the platform team per the thinnest-viable-platform
discipline. See
[service-scorecards-and-maturity-model-design](../[service-scorecards-and-maturity-model-design](../../../Product_and_Business/service-scorecards-and-maturity-model-design/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md),
[idp-adoption-rollout-and-[change-management](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/change-management/SKILL.md)-strategy](../[idp-adoption-rollout-and-[change-management](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/change-management/SKILL.md)-strategy](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/idp-adoption-rollout-and-[change-management](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/change-management/SKILL.md)-strategy/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md),
and
[platform-engineering-team-topology-and-operating-model](../[platform-engineering-team-topology-and-operating-model](../../../Product_and_Business/[platform-engineering](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Frontend/platform-engineering/SKILL.md)-team-topology-and-operating-model/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

## Best practices

- Treat Phase 3's image/chart mirroring as a permanent pipeline, not a
  one-time pre-load — every subsequent phase that references a new base
  image or chart version needs a corresponding mirror update, or Phase 5's
  golden path silently breaks for the next team that scaffolds from it.
- Test an actual etcd restore from a Phase 2 snapshot before the cluster
  carries real workloads, not for the first time during a real control-
  plane failure — see
  [etcd-backup-restore-and-cluster-health](../../../[kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[etcd-backup-restore-and-cluster-health](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/etcd-backup-restore-and-cluster-health/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).
- Decide Phase 8's tenancy model before Phase 7's self-service goes live
  for a second team — retrofitting namespace boundaries onto teams already
  sharing a cluster is materially harder than designing them in up front,
  and there's no cloud-account boundary to paper over the gap in the
  meantime.
- Validate hybrid failover paths (Phase 1) and the air-gapped install
  procedure (Phase 3) before relying on either, exactly as
  [on-prem-infrastructure-patterns](../../../cloud/skills/[on-prem-infrastructure-patterns](../on-prem-infrastructure-patterns/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  recommends — an untested air-gapped install script that quietly reaches
  out to the public internet during a live cutover is a common and
  avoidable failure.
- Keep an explicit [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) for procurement/[capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md) lead time next to
  Phase 1's inventory-as-code — a platform team used to cloud elasticity
  will otherwise plan Phase 7's self-service approval SLAs assuming
  [capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md) that isn't actually available on short notice.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** The golden-path template (Phase 5) works perfectly in the
  platform team's connected test environment but fails immediately at a
  real air-gapped site.
  **Fix:** Some step in the template's CI pipeline or Dockerfile has an
  unmirrored dependency (a base image tag not yet in the Phase 3 registry,
  an npm/yarn package resolving against the public registry). [Audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md) the
  full dependency chain against the site's actual network policy, not
  just against what worked during development, and add any missing
  artifact to the mirror before re-publishing the template.

- **Symptom:** The kubeadm-provisioned control plane (Phase 2) loses
  quorum after a single node failure, taking the whole cluster — including
  Backstage and the self-service layer — down with it.
  **Fix:** This usually means the etcd cluster was left at an
  even-numbered or too-small member count, or health/quorum [monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md)
  from
  [etcd-backup-restore-and-cluster-health](../../../[kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)-platform/skills/[etcd-backup-restore-and-cluster-health](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/etcd-backup-restore-and-cluster-health/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  was never actually wired up to alert before quorum was lost. Restore
  from the most recent verified snapshot, then correct the member count
  and [monitoring](../../Observability_and_SecOps/monitoring/SKILL.md) gap before declaring the cluster production-ready again.

- **Symptom:** A team requests self-service infrastructure (Phase 7) and
  the request sits unactioned for over a week because the named approver
  was on leave and no one else had visibility into the pending request.
  **Fix:** This is a consequence of routing approval through a single
  person and an unreliable notification channel rather than a
  role-based, monitored queue. Route approval to an internal role/group
  reachable through a channel the site actually guarantees (an internal
  ticketing system, not a single person's inbox), and set an explicit
  escalation SLA even without a cloud-based paging tool to automate it.

- **Symptom:** Two teams sharing the on-prem cluster (no Phase 8 tenancy
  boundaries yet defined) discover one team's workload has been silently
  reading traffic destined for the other's service.
  **Fix:** This is what happens when Phase 8 is treated as a later
  hardening pass instead of a prerequisite to onboarding a second tenant.
  Retrofit namespace-scoped RBAC and a default-deny NetworkPolicy
  immediately, and [audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md) every self-service request made before the fix
  for improperly-scoped access.

- **Symptom:** A platform engineer runs `[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) delete namespace` against
  what's believed to be a decommissioned team's workspace to reclaim
  [capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md), and it turns out another team's shared resources (a
  Crossplane-provisioned internal resource, a shared cache) were
  provisioned into the same namespace.
  **Fix:** This is destructive and, on self-hosted infrastructure with no
  managed-service undo path, often unrecoverable without a very recent
  backup. Never delete a tenant namespace without first confirming (via
  Phase 8's ownership model) that nothing shared or still in use lives in
  it, and prefer scaling a workload to zero over deleting its namespace
  when reclaiming [capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md) is the actual goal.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** "Anchorage Defense Systems" runs a regulated, network-
segmented on-prem environment with no reliable outbound internet access
and must self-host its entire IDP.

1. **Phase 1:** Inventory-as-code models three racks of [bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md) hosts;
   PXE-based automated provisioning installs the base OS; [capacity](../../../AI_and_Agents/Infrastructure/deploy-model/[capacity](../azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/[capacity](../../Observability_and_SecOps/capacity/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
   planning reserves headroom for one full node failure without service
   loss.
2. **Phase 2:** A kubeadm cluster `platform-onprem-01` bootstraps with a
   3-node stacked-etcd control plane behind a keepalived VIP; etcd
   snapshots are taken every 6 hours and a restore drill is run once
   before go-live.
3. **Phase 3:** An internal Harbor registry `registry.internal.anchorage`
   mirrors the Backstage image, Postgres image, and every Helm chart the
   build needs; it's exposed via ingress-nginx with a cert issued from the
   internal CA.
4. **Phase 4:** Backstage is packaged as `charts/backstage-anchorage`,
   deployed against an in-cluster Postgres instance on Rook-Ceph block
   storage, authenticating developers via the site's existing Active
   Directory.
5. **Phase 5:** A golden-path template's CI workflow runs on an internal
   [Jenkins](../../CI_CD/jenkins/SKILL.md) instance and pulls its base image exclusively from
   `registry.internal.anchorage`.
6. **Phase 6:** A validation pipeline scaffolds a test service on this
   same cluster's `ephemeral-validation` namespace and confirms zero
   outbound network calls occur during the build.
7. **Phase 7:** A Scaffolder action requests a new internal VM via a
   vSphere API call, gated by an approval routed to the
   `platform-approvers` AD group and tracked in the site's internal
   ticketing system with a 2-business-day escalation SLA.
8. **Phase 8:** Each of 5 onboarded teams gets a dedicated namespace with
   RBAC bound to its AD group, a ResourceQuota sized from its historical
   VM usage, and a default-deny NetworkPolicy.
9. **Phase 9:** A scorecard checks that every service's image resolves
   from the internal registry, and the platform team (2 people,
   part-time) is explicitly scoped per the thinnest-viable-platform model.
