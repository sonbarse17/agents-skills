# Orphaned Cloud Resource Cleanup

## Purpose

Every cloud account accumulates a background hum of resources that
outlived the thing they were attached to: an EBS volume/managed disk
left behind after its instance was terminated, an Elastic IP/Public IP
reserved for a test that was never released, a load balancer or target
group pointing at a service that was decommissioned months ago, a manual
snapshot taken "just in case" before a change that was never cleaned up
afterward. None of these show up as a dramatic cost spike — each is
individually cheap — but collectively, across dozens of accounts and
years of accumulation, they become a steady, invisible tax. This skill
covers finding these specific classes of orphaned resource and removing
them safely, with the non-negotiable discipline that "looks unattached"
and "is confirmed unused" are not the same thing — a resource detached
from its original parent can still be an intentional backup, a
[disaster-recovery](../../Observability_and_SecOps/disaster-recovery/SKILL.md) artifact, or something a team meant to reattach next
sprint.

## When to use

- A recurring or one-off request to reduce cloud waste by cleaning up
  unattached storage, unused reserved IPs, or orphaned network resources.
- A cost review or [cloud-cost-anomaly-investigation](../[cloud-cost-anomaly-investigation](../cloud-cost-anomaly-investigation/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  identifies a resource that appears unused and hands it off for
  confirmed, safe removal.
- Preparing an account/subscription for decommissioning and needing a
  complete sweep of everything left behind by long-terminated workloads.
- A cloud provider's own trusted-advisor/cost-recommendation tooling
  (AWS Trusted Advisor, Azure Advisor) flags idle resources and someone
  needs to action the list rather than let it sit.
- Setting up a *recurring* scheduled check for orphaned resources instead
  of a one-time manual sweep.

## Prerequisites & environment

- Read access to list resources and their attachment state: AWS CLI
  (`ec2`, `elb`/`elbv2`) or Trusted Advisor, Azure CLI (`az disk`,
  `az network public-ip`, `az network lb`) or Azure Advisor, `gcloud
  compute` for the GCP equivalents (persistent disks, static external IP
  addresses, forwarding rules/load balancers).
- Delete/release permissions scoped narrowly to the resource types being
  cleaned up — not a broad admin role — per
  [cloud-iam-hardening](../[cloud-iam-hardening](../cloud-iam-hardening/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md); a cleanup
  script should not be able to touch resources outside its stated scope.
- A tagging/labeling convention (`owner`, `environment`,
  `decommission-date`) to check before deleting anything — per
  [cloud-cost-finops-optimization](../[cloud-cost-finops-optimization](../cloud-cost-finops-optimization/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md) —
  since tag absence is itself a reason for extra caution, not a green
  light to delete faster.
- Awareness of, and a check against, any active
  [disaster-recovery-and-backup-strategy](../[disaster-recovery-and-backup-strategy](../[disaster-recovery](../../Observability_and_SecOps/disaster-recovery/SKILL.md)-and-backup-strategy/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  plan for the account/subscription — DR-pattern resources (a pilot-light
  database replica, a cross-region backup [vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md), a manually retained
  pre-migration snapshot) can look identical to genuine orphans from a
  pure "is it attached right now" query.
- A grace-period/quarantine mechanism (a tag, a holding folder/resource
  group, or a "stop, don't delete" first pass) rather than immediate
  hard deletion for the first pass of any new cleanup process.

## Step-by-step guidance

1. **Enumerate candidates by state, not by age alone.** Age is a weak
   signal on its own; attachment/association state is the primary
   filter.
   - **AWS unattached EBS volumes**:
     ```bash
     aws ec2 describe-volumes \
       --filters "Name=status,Values=available" \
       --query "Volumes[].{ID:VolumeId,Size:Size,Created:CreateTime,Tags:Tags}"
     ```
     (`available` = not attached to any instance; `in-use` volumes are
     excluded automatically by the filter.)
   - **Azure unattached managed disks**:
     ```bash
     az disk list --query "[?diskState=='Unattached'].{Name:name, Size:diskSizeGb, TimeCreated:timeCreated, Tags:tags}"
     ```
   - **AWS unassociated Elastic IPs**:
     ```bash
     aws ec2 describe-addresses \
       --query "Addresses[?AssociationId==null].{IP:PublicIp,AllocationId:AllocationId,Tags:Tags}"
     ```
   - **Azure unassociated Public IPs**:
     ```bash
     az network public-ip list --query "[?ipConfiguration==null].{Name:name, IP:ipAddress}"
     ```
   - **AWS orphaned/idle load balancers** (no healthy targets, or zero
     registered targets, over a sustained window):
     ```bash
     aws elbv2 describe-target-groups --query "TargetGroups[].TargetGroupArn" \
       | xargs -I{} aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn {}
     # empty TargetHealthDescriptions for a sustained period = candidate
     ```
   - **Azure orphaned load balancers** (no backend pool members):
     ```bash
     az network lb list --query "[?backendAddressPools[0].backendIpConfigurations==null].name"
     ```
   - **Stale manual snapshots** (AWS EBS snapshots / Azure disk
     snapshots not tied to a backup policy, older than a defined
     threshold):
     ```bash
     aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner-ids self \
       --query "Snapshots[?StartTime<='2026-04-01'].{ID:SnapshotId,VolumeId:VolumeId,Description:Description}"
     ```

2. **Cross-check every candidate against tags and DR/backup policy
   before treating it as a true orphan.** A resource with an `owner` tag
   still active, or one covered by
   [disaster-recovery-and-backup-strategy](../[disaster-recovery-and-backup-strategy](../[disaster-recovery](../../Observability_and_SecOps/disaster-recovery/SKILL.md)-and-backup-strategy/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)'s
   backup [vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md)/retention policy (e.g. a snapshot inside an AWS Backup
   [Vault](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/vault/SKILL.md) Lock retention window, or a disk explicitly retained as a
   pilot-light DR asset), is not a cleanup candidate regardless of
   attachment state. Filter these out of the candidate list before
   proceeding, don't just note them for later.

3. **Confirm true non-use with a second signal beyond attachment
   state**, not attachment state alone:
   - Check the resource's **creation/last-modified timestamp** against
     a reasonable minimum age (e.g. 14-30 days) — a volume detached
     yesterday during an in-progress migration is not the same as one
     detached for six months.
   - Check **CloudTrail/Activity Log/Cloud [Audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md) Logs** for the
     resource ID to see who detached/created it and why, if the event is
     still within retention.
   - For Elastic IPs/Public IPs specifically, check whether it's
     referenced in any DNS record, firewall allow-list, or partner/
     customer-facing allowlist (a "detached" IP that a customer
     whitelisted is a functional dependency even with no cloud-side
     association).
   - For a snapshot, confirm no automation (a backup job, an AMI/image
     build pipeline) references it as a source before deleting — grep
     [Infrastructure-as-code](../../Infrastructure_as_Code/infrastructure-as-code/SKILL.md) and AMI/image build configs for the
     snapshot/disk ID.

4. **Notify the owner (or last-known owner from tags/[audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md) logs) with a
   grace period before deleting**, rather than deleting immediately on
   finding a candidate:
   ```bash
   # Example: tag as pending-deletion with a future date instead of deleting immediately
   aws ec2 create-tags --resources vol-0123456789abcdef0 \
     --tags Key=pending-deletion,Value=2026-08-11 Key=flagged-by,Value=cleanup-sweep-2026-07
   ```
   Equivalent on Azure: `az tag update` or a resource-group-level
   "quarantine" tag. Send the notification (email, Slack, a ticket) to
   the tagged/last-known owner, or to a general platform-team channel if
   no owner can be identified, with the deletion date and an easy way to
   object.

5. **Delete only after the grace period elapses with no objection**, and
   only the specific confirmed-orphaned resource — never as a bulk
   "delete everything matching the filter" pass without the per-resource
   confirmation from steps 2-3:
   ```bash
   # AWS: release an unassociated Elastic IP
   aws ec2 release-address --allocation-id <ALLOCATION_ID>
   # AWS: delete a confirmed-unattached EBS volume
   aws ec2 delete-volume --volume-id <VOLUME_ID>
   ```
   ```bash
   # Azure: release/delete an unassociated Public IP
   az network public-ip delete --name <PUBLIC_IP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP>
   # Azure: delete a confirmed-unattached managed disk
   az disk delete --name <DISK_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --yes
   ```
   > **Warning:** These are destructive, typically irreversible actions
   > (a deleted EBS volume/managed disk cannot be recovered unless a
   > snapshot exists independently; a released Elastic IP/Public IP may
   > be reassigned to another customer entirely and is not guaranteed
   > recoverable). Never run a bulk delete loop directly off the
   > enumeration query in step 1 — always pass every candidate through
   > steps 2-4 first, and prefer taking a final safety snapshot of a
   > volume/disk immediately before deleting it if there is any residual
   > uncertainty.

6. **For load balancers/target groups with zero targets**, confirm the
   downstream DNS/service discovery record no longer points at it before
   deletion — an idle-looking load balancer can still be the intended
   target of a DNS record for a service currently scaled to zero rather
   than decommissioned (e.g. a batch/seasonal workload).

7. **Automate the enumeration + notify steps as a recurring scheduled
   job** (weekly/monthly), not a one-time manual sweep — orphaned
   resources accumulate continuously as workloads are terminated, so a
   one-time cleanup regresses within a quarter without a recurring
   check. Keep the deletion step itself either manual (a human clicks
   "confirm") or gated behind the same grace-period/notification logic
   even when automated.

8. **Track and report savings realized**, feeding it back into the
   FinOps showback view — a completed cleanup sweep is good input for
   [cloud-cost-finops-optimization](../[cloud-cost-finops-optimization](../cloud-cost-finops-optimization/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)'s
   reporting, and demonstrates the recurring check's value to
   stakeholders who might otherwise question the process overhead.

## Best practices

- **Attachment/association state is a necessary but not sufficient
  signal** — always corroborate with age, tags, [audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md)-log history, and
  DR/backup policy before calling anything a confirmed orphan.
- **Always insert a tagged grace period between "identified as a
  candidate" and "deleted"** — a notify-then-wait step costs a few days
  and catches the cases where the resource wasn't actually orphaned.
- **Snapshot before delete when there's any residual doubt** — an extra
  final snapshot of a volume/disk is cheap insurance against an
  irreversible mistake, especially for anything that held data.
- **Never run cleanup as a single bulk command against a raw enumeration
  query** — always filter, confirm, notify, then act per-resource (or in
  small confirmed batches), so a scripting mistake can't delete an
  entire account's worth of storage in one pass.
- **Prefer scoped delete/release IAM permissions for the cleanup role
  itself** — a cleanup automation account should not hold broader
  permissions than exactly what it needs to enumerate, tag, and delete
  the specific resource types in scope.
- **Make the recurring sweep's findings visible before deleting anything
  automatically** — a dashboard or weekly digest of candidates builds
  trust in the process faster than silent automated deletion, even once
  the process is mature.
- **Treat a resource with no tags as higher risk, not lower** — an
  untagged resource is more likely to be a forgotten manual creation
  from years ago than a well-managed, safe-to-delete artifact; slow down
  and dig into [audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md)-log history rather than treating tag absence as
  "nobody will miss it."

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** A cleanup script deletes an unattached EBS volume that
  turns out to be a manually detached backup source a team relied on,
  and the data is unrecoverable.
  **Fix:** **Never auto-delete storage resources flagged as idle without
  a grace period, notification, and human confirmation** — this is
  destructive and often irreversible. Always run candidates through the
  tag/[audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md)-log/DR-policy cross-check (steps 2-3) and the notify-then-
  wait grace period (step 4) before any deletion, especially for
  anything that held data.

- **Symptom:** A released Elastic IP/Public IP that "looked unused" was
  actually allowlisted by a customer's firewall or referenced in a
  partner integration's static-IP allowlist, and releasing it breaks
  that integration when the IP gets reassigned elsewhere.
  **Fix:** Cloud-side association state doesn't capture external
  dependencies. Before releasing any IP, check firewall rules, DNS
  records, and any documented partner/customer allowlist referencing
  it — treat a static IP as higher-risk to release than a volume, since
  the consequence of a mistake (address reassigned to an unrelated
  account) is harder to reverse than restoring from a snapshot.

- **Symptom:** A load balancer with zero currently-registered targets
  gets deleted, and it turns out to be the intended target of a
  scheduled/seasonal batch workload that scales up only once a quarter.
  **Fix:** Zero targets *right now* isn't the same as permanently
  unused. Check the load balancer's target-group history and any
  scheduled-scaling configuration over a longer window (at least one
  full scaling cycle) before concluding it's orphaned, and confirm with
  the owning team from its tags/naming convention.

- **Symptom:** A recurring cleanup sweep starts flagging (and someone
  eventually deletes) a cross-region backup snapshot or a pilot-light DR
  replica because it looks idle by the same criteria used for genuine
  orphans.
  **Fix:** DR-pattern resources are *supposed* to look idle under normal
  operating conditions — that's not the same as orphaned. Explicitly
  exclude resources tagged or known to be part of an active
  [disaster-recovery-and-backup-strategy](../[disaster-recovery-and-backup-strategy](../[disaster-recovery](../../Observability_and_SecOps/disaster-recovery/SKILL.md)-and-backup-strategy/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  plan from the candidate list at step 2, and require sign-off from
  whoever owns the DR plan before touching anything that might be one.

- **Symptom:** The cleanup process finds hundreds of untagged candidates
  and, to move fast, someone deletes everything older than a threshold
  in one bulk pass.
  **Fix:** Volume of candidates is not a reason to skip per-resource
  confirmation — it's a reason to batch the *notification* step (a
  single digest listing all candidates with their grace-period deadline)
  while still deleting only after the individual grace period elapses
  unobjected, never as one undifferentiated bulk delete command.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** A monthly scheduled cleanup sweep runs against a
`checkout-nonprod` AWS account and finds 14 unattached EBS volumes, 3
unassociated Elastic IPs, and 1 load balancer with no registered targets.

1. Enumerate candidates (step 1): the `describe-volumes --filters
   Name=status,Values=available` query returns 14 volumes; cross-checked
   against `describe-addresses` and `describe-target-health`.
2. Cross-check tags and DR policy (step 2): 2 of the 14 volumes carry a
   `dr-role=pilot-light-replica-source` tag matching an entry in the
   account's DR [runbook](../../Observability_and_SecOps/runbook/SKILL.md) — excluded immediately, not just noted.
3. Confirm non-use signal (step 3): of the remaining 12 volumes, 9 have a
   `CreateTime`/detachment timestamp older than 60 days with no matching
   CloudTrail `DetachVolume` event tied to an active migration; 3 were
   detached only 4 days ago during an in-progress instance-type change
   still tracked in an open ticket — those 3 are excluded from this
   sweep and re-checked next month.
4. Tag and notify (step 4): the 9 confirmed candidates are tagged
   `pending-deletion=2026-08-11`, and a digest listing all 9 (volume ID,
   size, last-known owner tag or "untagged — flagging platform-team
   channel") is posted to the team channel with a two-week grace period.
5. One volume gets claimed within the grace period — an engineer
   recognizes it as a rollback safety net for a change happening the
   following week — and its `pending-deletion` tag is removed.
6. After the grace period, the remaining 8 volumes and the 3
   unassociated Elastic IPs (independently confirmed via DNS/allowlist
   check to have no external references) are deleted/released
   individually via scripted per-resource calls, not a single bulk
   command, with each deletion logged to the sweep's completion report.
7. The idle load balancer is checked against its target group's history
   over the trailing quarter (step 6): no scheduled scaling activity or
   recent target registration in 90 days, and its name matches a service
   decommissioned two releases ago per the deploy history — confirmed
   orphaned and deleted after the same notify/grace-period cycle.
8. Total savings (volume storage, IP reservation fees, load balancer
   hourly charge) are reported back into the account's FinOps showback
   dashboard for the month.
