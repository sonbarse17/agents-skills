## Workflow

### Step 1: Backend Selection

#### Object Store Comparison

| Feature | AWS S3 | ADLS Gen2 | GCS | MinIO |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Consistency | Read-after-write | Strong | Strong | Strong |
| Auth | IAM roles, bucket policies | RBAC, SAS tokens | IAM, service accounts | JWT, OIDC, LDAP |
| Encryption | SSE-S3/KMS/CSE | SSE-AES/KMS/CMK | Google-managed/CMEK/CSE | KMS, auto-encryption |
| Lifecycle | Transition, expiry, versioning | Tiering, soft-delete | Nearline/Coldline/Archive | Bucket lifecycle |
| Max object size | 5 TB | 4.75 TB | 5 TB | 100 TB (configurable) |
| S3 Compatible | Native | Yes (via gateway) | Yes (XML API) | Native |
| Cost (per TB/mo) | ~$23 (standard) | ~$20 (hot) | ~$20 (standard) | Hardware + ops |
| Durability | 99.999999999% (11 9s) | 99.999999999% (11 9s) | 99.999999999% (11 9s) | Configurable |
| Availability SLA | 99.99% | 99.9% | 99.95% | Depends on setup |

#### Backend Selection Decision Tree
```
Cloud provider?
├── AWS → S3 (best integration with AWS ecosystem)
├── Azure → ADLS Gen2 (best with Azure AD, Active Directory)
├── GCP → GCS (strong consistency, best for Google ecosystem)
├── Multi-cloud → MinIO (S3-compatible layer across clouds)
└── On-premise / air-gapped → MinIO or HDFS

Primary workload?
├── Data lake with compute engines → Object store (S3/ADLS/GCS)
├── Legacy Hadoop/Spark without cloud → HDFS
├── Private cloud, edge, or air-gapped → MinIO
└── High-performance computing → Parallel file system (Lustre, GPFS)
```

### Step 2: Storage Tiering

#### Tier Characteristics

| Tier | Storage Class | Latency | Cost/TB/mo | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hot | S3 Standard, ADLS Hot | Millisecond | ~$23 | Active data, daily pipelines, ML training |
| Warm | S3 Infrequent Access | Millisecond | ~$12.50 | Monthly queries, staging data |
| Cold | S3 Glacier Instant | Millisecond (instant) | ~$4 | Quarterly access, compliance retention |
| Archive | S3 Glacier Deep Archive | 12 hours | ~$1 | Annual access, legal holds |

#### Tiering Strategy
Hot: last 30-90 days of data. Warm: 90 days to 1 year. Cold: 1-3 years. Archive: 3-7+ years (retention-based). Intelligent tiering (S3) auto-moves objects between hot and warm based on access patterns.

### Step 3: Lifecycle Policies

```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "Id": "TierAndExpire",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Filter": { "Prefix": "logs/" },
      "Transitions": [
        { "Days": 30, "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA" },
        { "Days": 90, "StorageClass": "GLACIER" },
        { "Days": 365, "StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE" }
      ],
      "Expiration": { "Days": 2555 }
    },
    {
      "Id": "ExpireTempFiles",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Filter": { "Prefix": "tmp/" },
      "Expiration": { "Days": 7 }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Durability and Replication

#### Object Store Durability
S3/ADLS/GCS provide 11 9s of durability via erasure coding across multiple devices/facilities. Replication is handled by the cloud provider. For additional protection: cross-region replication (CRR) for disaster recovery, same-region replication (SRR) for compliance.

#### HDFS Replication
Default replication factor: 3 (1 primary, 2 replicas on different racks). Storage overhead: 3x. Erasure coding reduces overhead: RS-6-3 (1.33x overhead), RS-10-4 (1.5x overhead). EC recommended for cold data on HDFS (> 100TB).

#### Backup and DR
Cross-region backup for critical data. Versioning enabled on all buckets. Replication Rules: replicate Tier 1 data to DR region synchronously or asynchronously. Test restore quarterly.

### Step 5: Compression and Encoding

| Codec | Speed | Compression Ratio | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| ZSTD (level 3) | Very fast | Good (2-4x) | Default for Parquet/ORC |
| GZIP (level 6) | Moderate | Best (3-6x) | Archive, cold data |
| Snappy | Fastest | Fair (1.5-3x) | Streaming, hot data |
| LZ4 | Fastest | Fair (1.5-2x) | Logs, real-time |
| BZIP2 | Slow | Best (4-8x) | Archive only |

Compress data at the file format level (Parquet/ORC) rather than at the transport level. Avoid double compression. Test: compress a representative dataset with each codec, measure speed and ratio.

### Step 6: Data Layout

#### Partitioning by File Structure
Organize storage by: source/system, data domain, date partition, file. Example: `s3://data-lake/raw/salesforce/orders/year=2026/month=05/day=01/load_id=abc123/orders_001.parquet`. This layout enables: partition pruning, easy lifecycle management, clear ownership boundaries.

#### File Size Targets
Small files cause performance problems for query engines. Target file size: 128MB-1GB. Use compaction jobs to merge small files. Monitor average file size per dataset.

### Step 7: HDFS Architecture

#### NameNode and DataNode
Active NameNode manages filesystem metadata (namespace, blocks, locations). Standby NameNode for HA via QJM (Quorum Journal Manager). DataNodes store block data and report to NameNode. Block size: 128MB or 256MB default. Rack awareness for replica placement.

#### HDFS Key Config
```yaml
# hdfs-site.xml
dfs.replication: 3
dfs.block.size: 268435456  # 256MB
dfs.namenode.handler.count: 100
dfs.datanode.handler.count: 50
dfs.namenode.gc.time.threshold: 60s
dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period: 3600  # 1 hour
dfs.permissions.enabled: true
```

### Step 8: Security

#### Encryption at Rest
Server-side encryption: SSE-S3 (AES-256, S3-managed keys), SSE-KMS (AWS KMS-managed keys), SSE-C (customer-provided keys). Client-side encryption: encrypt before upload, decrypt after download. For compliance: SSE-KMS with audit logging.

#### Encryption in Transit
TLS 1.2+ for all S3/ADLS/GCS API calls. Enforce HTTPS-only bucket policies. HDFS: enable SSL for RPC and data transfer.

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::data-lake/*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": { "aws:SecureTransport": "false" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 9: Cost Optimization

#### Strategies
Use intelligent tiering for automatic cost savings on variable-access data. Request (S3) Reduced Redundancy for non-critical data (lower durability = lower cost). Reserved capacity for predictable usage. Monitor and alert on cost anomalies.

#### Cost Monitoring
Track: storage cost per bucket/container, data transfer costs (egress), request costs (PUT/GET/LIST), lifecycle transition costs. Allocate costs to teams/domains via tag-based cost allocation.

### Decision Trees

#### Storage Backend
```
Cloud adoption strategy?
├── Single cloud → Native object store (S3/ADLS/GCS)
├── Multi-cloud → MinIO (abstraction layer)
├── On-premise
│   ├── Hadoop ecosystem → HDFS
│   └── Kubernetes-native → MinIO (S3-compatible)
└── Edge / IoT → MinIO (lightweight, S3 API)
```

#### Lifecycle Policy
```
Data access pattern?
├── Accessed frequently → Hot tier (delete when no longer needed)
├── Accessed occasionally → Intelligent tiering or manual tiering
├── Compliance retention → Write once, tier to cold → delete after retention
└── Temporary data → Hot tier → delete in 7-30 days
```

### MinIO Deployment Architecture

#### Multi-Node Setup
MinIO runs as a distributed system across multiple nodes. Minimum 4 nodes for erasure coding protection. Each node: 4+ drives, SSD/NVMe preferred for performance. Deployed via: Docker Compose (dev/tiny), Kubernetes Operator (production), bare metal (HPC).

```yaml
# MinIO Kubernetes Operator
apiVersion: minio.min.io/v2
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: data-lake-storage
spec:
  image: quay.io/minio/minio:latest
  credsSecret:
    name: minio-creds
  pools:
    - servers: 4
      volumesPerServer: 4
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: ssd
          accessModes: [ReadWriteOnce]
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 4Ti
  mountPath: /export
  requestAutoCert: true
  buckets:
    - name: raw
    - name: staging
    - name: analytics
```

#### Erasure Coding
MinIO uses Reed-Solomon erasure coding. Default parity: N/2 drives (max protection). Configurable: standard (EC:4) for 8-drive setup, reduced (EC:2) for performance. Read tolerance: lose up to N/2 drives. Write tolerance: lose up to N/2 drives. Storage overhead: 2x for N/2 parity, 1.33x for N/4 parity.

```yaml
# Erasure coding parity by deployment size
# 4 nodes × 4 drives = 16 drives
#   EC:8 → tolerate 8 drive failures, 2x overhead
#   EC:4 → tolerate 4 drive failures, 1.33x overhead
#   EC:2 → tolerate 2 drive failures, 1.14x overhead

# Set via environment variable
MINIO_STORAGE_CLASS_STANDARD: "EC:4"
MINIO_STORAGE_CLASS_RRS: "EC:2"     # Reduced redundancy for temp data
```

#### Performance Tuning
```yaml
# Drive-level
# Use XFS filesystem with noatime,nodiratime mount options
# Separate write-intensive (metadata, WAL) from read-intensive drives

# Network-level
# MinIO uses S3-compatible HTTP/REST
# Enable HTTP/2 for multiplexing
# Use load balancer (nginx, HAProxy) for multi-node distribution

# Kernel tuning
# net.core.rmem_max: 134217728    # 128MB receive buffer
# net.core.wmem_max: 134217728    # 128MB send buffer
# net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control: bbr  # BBR for better throughput
# vm.dirty_ratio: 30              # Page cache dirty ratio
# vm.dirty_background_ratio: 10
```

### Step 10: Data Transfer and Migration

#### Transfer Acceleration
```yaml
# AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration
# Uses CloudFront edge locations, TCP optimization
# Enable: s3.put_bucket_accelerate_configuration
# Best for: cross-region uploads, large objects > 1GB
# Cost: premium per GB transferred
# Test: s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com

# Azure Data Box / Import-Export
# Physical transfer: Data Box (80TB), Data Box Disk (8TB)
# For: > 10TB initial loads, slow networks, air-gapped
# Timeline: order → receive → load → return → ingest (2-4 weeks)

# GCS Storage Transfer Service
# Online: from S3, HTTP, or GS URLs
# Schedule: one-time or recurring
# Best for: ongoing sync from S3 to GCS
```

#### Migration Strategy
```yaml
migration_phases:
  phase_1_assessment:
    - inventory current storage (total TB, object count, avg size)
    - identify access patterns (hot vs cold, frequency)
    - document retention and compliance requirements
    - estimate egress costs and transfer time
  
  phase_2_pilot:
    - migrate 1-2 TB of non-critical data first
    - validate performance, cost, and access patterns
    - document issues and adjust strategy
  
  phase_3_bulk:
    - parallel multi-threaded copy (aws s3 sync, rclone, distcp)
    - validate data integrity checksums post-transfer
    - monitor for failures (rate limits, timeouts)
  
  phase_4_cutover:
    - final sync of delta changes
    - update application configs to point to new storage
    - redirect DNS / endpoint to new location
    - decommission old storage after 30-day validation window
```

### Step 11: Compliance Features

#### Object Lock / WORM
```yaml
# S3 Object Lock (compliance mode)
# Prevents object deletion or overwrite for retention period
# Governance mode: users with special permissions can override
# Compliance mode: no one (including root) can override
# Legal hold: prevents deletion regardless of retention

object_lock_examples:
  - name: "Financial records (SOX)"
    mode: COMPLIANCE
    retention_days: 2555  # 7 years
    bucket: "data-lake/finance/"
  
  - name: "Logs (internal policy)"
    mode: GOVERNANCE
    retention_days: 365  # 1 year
    bucket: "data-lake/logs/"

# ADLS Gen2: immutability policy
# Set at container level
# Time-based retention or legal hold
```

#### Data Residency
```yaml
# Data residency requirements
# GDPR: data must stay in EU region
# Financial services: data within country borders
# Healthcare: HIPAA requires US-only storage (for US patients)

# Implementation:
# - Per-region buckets with IAM restrictions
# - S3 bucket policies denying cross-region replication for sensitive data
# - MinIO multi-tenant deployment per region
# - Regular audit to verify no data leaves allowed regions
```

### Step 12: Cost Modeling

#### Cost Components
```yaml
cost_components:
  storage:
    - per-GB-month by tier (hot, warm, cold, archive)
    - minimum storage duration charges (Glazer: 90 days min)
    - early deletion fees (cold/archive tiers)
  
  operations:
    - PUT/COPY/POST/LIST requests (per 1000)
    - GET/SELECT requests (per 1000)
    - lifecycle transition requests (per 1000)
  
  data_transfer:
    - upload (usually free)
    - download / egress (per GB, tiered pricing)
    - cross-region replication (per GB)
    - transfer acceleration (premium per GB)
  
  additional:
    - encryption (KMS: per key, per API call)
    - monitoring (CloudWatch, metrics per custom metric)
    - backup / replication (CRR storage in destination region)
```

#### Estimation Tool
```yaml
# Monthly storage cost estimate
cost_estimate:
  hot_data:
    volume: 50 TB
    unit_cost: $23/TB/mo
    subtotal: $1,150/mo
  
  warm_data:
    volume: 150 TB
    unit_cost: $12.50/TB/mo
    subtotal: $1,875/mo
  
  cold_data:
    volume: 300 TB
    unit_cost: $4/TB/mo
    subtotal: $1,200/mo
  
  archive_data:
    volume: 500 TB
    unit_cost: $1/TB/mo
    subtotal: $500/mo
  
  operations:
    requests: $200/mo  # Based on 10M PUT + 100M GET
  
  data_transfer:
    egress: $300/mo    # Based on 10TB egress
  
  monitoring_backup:
    cross_region_replication: $500/mo  # 50TB replicated
    monitoring: $100/mo
  
  total_monthly: $5,825/mo
  total_annual: $69,900/yr
```

### Step 13: Monitoring and Observability

#### Storage Metrics
```yaml
# Object store monitoring (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCS Ops)
metrics:
  storage:
    - BucketSizeBytes (by storage tier)
    - NumberOfObjects
    - AverageObjectSize
  
  requests:
    - AllRequests (count)
    - GetRequests / PutRequests / ListRequests
    - 4xxErrors / 5xxErrors
    - FirstByteLatency / TotalRequestLatency
  
  throughput:
    - BytesDownloaded / BytesUploaded
    - GetBandwidth / PutBandwidth (MB/s)
  
  cost:
    - StorageCost (by bucket/tag)
    - RequestCost
    - DataTransferCost
    - TotalCost
```

#### Alerting Thresholds
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "Storage growth anomaly"
    metric: BucketSizeBytes
    threshold: "> 20% week-over-week increase"
    severity: warning
    
  - name: "Error rate spike"
    metric: 5xxErrors
    threshold: "> 1% of total requests"
    severity: critical
    
  - name: "Latency degradation"
    metric: FirstByteLatency
    threshold: "p99 > 500ms"
    severity: warning
    
  - name: "Budget threshold"
    metric: TotalCost
    threshold: "> 80% of monthly budget" 
    severity: warning
    
  - name: "Lifecycle failure"
    metric: LifecycleTransitions
    threshold: "transitions failed > 10 per hour"
    severity: warning
```

### Decision Trees (continued)

#### Compression Codec Selection
```
Workload type?
├── Hot data, frequent queries → ZSTD (level 3) — fast decompression
├── Cold data, archive → GZIP (level 6) — best compression ratio
├── Streaming, low-latency → Snappy or LZ4 — minimal CPU overhead
├── Columnar formats (Parquet/ORC)
│   ├── Default → ZSTD (best balance)
│   └── Legacy compatibility → Snappy
└── JSON/CSV files
    ├── Compressed → GZIP (most tools support it)
    └── Splittable → BZIP2 or LZ4
```

#### Replication Strategy
```
Compliance requirement?
├── Disaster recovery (region outage)
│   ├── RTO < 1 hour → Synchronous CRR
│   └── RTO < 4 hours → Asynchronous CRR
├── Data sovereignty (must stay in region)
│   └── Same-region replication (SRR) + backup to another AZ
├── GDPR right to erasure
│   ├── Replicate selectively (no unnecessary copies)
│   └── Document replication topology for audit
└── No compliance requirement
    └── No replication — rely on cloud provider durability
```
