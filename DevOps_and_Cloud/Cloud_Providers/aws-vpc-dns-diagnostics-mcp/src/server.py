"""
DNS Diagnostic MCP Server for AWS DevOps Agent.

Three tool families in one server:

  * list_sops / get_sop - bundled diagnostic runbooks carrying the decision
                    trees, precedence model, trap semantics, and reporting rules
                    for interpreting results. The agent fetches guidance at
                    runtime instead of relying on preloaded instructions.
  * dns_probe_*    (Mode A) - live, comparative, multi-resolver DNS diagnosis run
                    inside a target EC2 instance via SSM Run Command. Returns a
                    per-name, per-resolver, per-family answer matrix plus a
                    VPC-attribute precondition block.
  * dns_simulate_* (Mode B) - symbolic pre-change validation of the VPC's
                    effective (direct + Route 53 Profile-inherited) DNS
                    resolution, using control-plane reads only.

Safety model:
  * Enforced allowlists. Mode A exposes only parameterized probe templates with
    strict input validation - no free shell. Mode B is read-only describe/list.
  * Per-tool-family credential scoping. The function assumes a read-only role for
    simulate calls and a separate probe role (whose sole privileged grant is a
    resource-scoped ssm:SendCommand to one diagnostic document) for probe calls.
    A read-only call never rides on a role holding ssm:SendCommand.
  * Fail-closed production enforcement. Wildcard allowlists are refused when
    STAGE_NAME=prod.
  * Account / region / VPC / resolver allowlists enforced in one place.

Transport: Streamable HTTP (via Lambda Web Adapter + Function URL, SigV4 auth).
