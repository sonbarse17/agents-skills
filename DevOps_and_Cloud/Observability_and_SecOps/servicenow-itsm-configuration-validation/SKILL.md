# ServiceNow ITSM Configuration Validation

## Purpose

A ServiceNow workflow can look correct in the Flow Designer canvas —
reasonable-looking approval steps, a CMDB-driven routing rule, a sync
flow wired to the paging tool — and still fail in exactly the moment it
matters most: a real Sev1 [incident](../incident/SKILL.md) where an Emergency Change sits
waiting on an approver who's on vacation, or a new service's incidents
silently pile up in a generic "Unassigned" queue because its CMDB
Configuration Item was never linked to an owning team. Because these
defects are invisible during normal operation (nobody triggers an
Emergency Change on a quiet Tuesday, nobody notices a routing gap until
a genuinely new service ships), the configuration underlying
[servicenow-itsm-integration](../[servicenow-itsm-integration](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/servicenow-itsm-integration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
needs to be validated *before* it's depended on, not discovered as a
finding during an actual [incident](../incident/SKILL.md) postmortem. This skill covers
systematically checking CMDB-driven assignment routing for coverage
gaps, verifying Emergency Change approval groups are actually
reachable (not a single named individual who might be unavailable),
confirming bidirectional sync flows are idempotent rather than
duplicate- or loop-prone, and walking workflow transitions for dead
ends — as a recurring validation discipline, not a one-time
read-through at initial setup.

## When to use

- Before relying on a newly configured Change Request workflow,
  assignment-routing flow, or paging-tool sync flow in production — same
  day it's built, not after the first real [incident](../incident/SKILL.md) exercises it.
- After any CMDB reorganization, service ownership change, or new
  service onboarding, to confirm assignment routing still resolves
  correctly for every in-scope Configuration Item.
- Periodically (e.g. quarterly, or alongside a broader on-call/escalation
  [audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md)) as a standing check rather than only reactively.
- Investigating "why did this [incident](../incident/SKILL.md) land in the wrong assignment
  group" or "why did the Emergency Change approval take 40 minutes
  instead of the target 15" after the fact, to distinguish a structural
  configuration gap from a one-off human delay.
- Before a ServiceNow instance upgrade, a Flow Designer migration, or a
  reorg that touches many workflows/approval definitions at once.
- Reviewing a proposed new Change type, approval definition, or
  assignment rule submitted by another team before it goes live.

## Prerequisites & environment

- Read access to the ServiceNow instance's Table API
  (`${SNOW_INSTANCE_URL}`) covering `[incident](../incident/SKILL.md)`, `change_request`,
  `problem`, `cmdb_ci`, `sys_user_group`, and the relevant approval
  (`sysapproval_approver`) tables, plus Flow Designer flow definitions —
  validating routing/approval logic requires reading the *resolved*
  configuration (which group a CI actually maps to right now), not just
  a static diagram.
- Familiarity with the workflow/routing/sync mechanics this skill
  validates — see
  [servicenow-itsm-integration](../[servicenow-itsm-integration](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/servicenow-itsm-integration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  for how they're built, since this skill assumes that configuration
  already exists and is strictly about proving it's correct.
- A non-production ServiceNow instance or scoped test records (a test
  [Incident](../incident/SKILL.md), a test CI) to safely exercise a Change workflow's approval
  routing end-to-end without creating a real, customer-visible Change
  Request in production.
- Access to the CMDB's CI-to-assignment-group relationship data
  (`cmdb_rel_ci` or an equivalent custom mapping table) to check for
  gaps — a CI with no owning-group relationship is the most common root
  cause of misrouted incidents.
- Clarity on who the org considers a valid Emergency Change approver
  (a role, not a single named person) so "is this approval group
  reachable" has an actual answer to validate against, mirroring the
  same on-call-reachability concern covered in
  [pagerduty-opsgenie-configuration-validation](../[pagerduty-opsgenie-configuration-validation](../pagerduty-opsgenie-configuration-validation/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  for paging escalation policies.
- A place to run this validation on a recurring schedule (a scheduled
  Flow Designer subflow, a scripted job against the Table API, or a CI
  job in whatever pipeline manages ServiceNow configuration as code) so
  it's a standing [audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md), not a one-off manual review.

## Step-by-step guidance

1. **Check every in-scope CMDB CI resolves to a real, current assignment
   group** — a CI with no owner relationship, or one pointing at a
   retired/renamed group, silently produces the "lands in Unassigned"
   failure mode:
   ```http
   GET /api/now/table/cmdb_ci?sysparm_query=operational_status=1
   ```
   For each returned CI, resolve its owning group:
   ```http
   GET /api/now/table/cmdb_rel_ci?sysparm_query=parent=<CI_SYS_ID>^type.name=Owns
   ```
   Flag any CI with zero resolved owning-group relationships, or one
   resolving to a `sys_user_group` record marked inactive, as a routing
   gap requiring an owner to be assigned before the CI is considered
   production-ready.

2. **Validate the assignment-routing flow against a representative
   sample of CIs**, not just by reading the Flow Designer logic —
   create a test [Incident](../incident/SKILL.md) against several real (or realistic test) CIs
   and confirm the resulting `assignment_group` matches expectation:
   ```http
   POST /api/now/table/[incident](../incident/SKILL.md)
   { "short_description": "routing validation test", "cmdb_ci": "<TEST_CI_SYS_ID>" }
   ```
   ```http
   GET /api/now/table/[incident](../incident/SKILL.md)/<NEW_INCIDENT_SYS_ID>?sysparm_fields=assignment_group
   ```
   Delete/close the test [incident](../incident/SKILL.md) afterward; run this against a handful
   of CIs spanning different business units, not just one "obviously
   fine" example.

3. **Verify the Emergency Change approval group resolves to at least
   two genuinely reachable, currently-active people right now** — the
   same single-point-of-failure check
   [pagerduty-opsgenie-configuration-validation](../[pagerduty-opsgenie-configuration-validation](../pagerduty-opsgenie-configuration-validation/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
   applies to paging escalation policies, applied to ServiceNow's
   approval definition instead:
   ```http
   GET /api/now/table/sys_user_group?sysparm_query=name=emergency-cab-approvers
   GET /api/now/table/sys_user_grmember?sysparm_query=group=<GROUP_SYS_ID>
   ```
   For each returned member, confirm the linked `sys_user` record is
   `active=true` and not, e.g., someone who left the company but was
   never removed from the group — a group listing five names where only
   one is still active/reachable is functionally a single point of
   failure identical to an escalation policy whose rungs all resolve to
   the same person.

4. **Time a real (test-instance) Emergency Change approval end to end**,
   not just confirm the approval definition exists:
   ```http
   POST /api/now/table/change_request
   { "type": "emergency", "short_description": "validation test — emergency change timing", "justification": "scheduled validation, not a real [incident](../incident/SKILL.md)" }
   ```
   Track wall-clock time from creation to the first approval action in
   a non-production run; compare against the target SLA (e.g. 15
   minutes) the org has committed to. A slow test result surfaces a
   process/notification gap (approvers not actually getting notified
   promptly) before a real Sev1 exposes it.

5. **Walk every workflow transition for a dead end** — a state with no
   valid outbound transition under some condition, which leaves a real
   [incident](../incident/SKILL.md)/change stuck with no way to progress except a manual
   database update:
   ```http
   GET /api/now/table/wf_transition?sysparm_query=workflow=<WORKFLOW_SYS_ID>
   ```
   For each state in the workflow, confirm at least one outbound
   transition exists for every realistic condition (approved, rejected,
   cancelled, timed out) — a `state=Awaiting Approval` with only an
   "Approved" outbound transition and no "Rejected"/"Cancelled" path
   is a dead end the moment a real approver rejects the request.

6. **Confirm the paging-tool sync flow is idempotent**, not
   insert-always, by replaying a duplicate webhook delivery against a
   test record and confirming no duplicate [Incident](../incident/SKILL.md) is created:
   ```http
   # Send the same correlation_id twice
   POST /api/now/table/[incident](../incident/SKILL.md)
   { "correlation_id": "PD-INC-VALIDATION-TEST", "short_description": "sync idempotency test" }
   POST /api/now/table/[incident](../incident/SKILL.md)
   { "correlation_id": "PD-INC-VALIDATION-TEST", "short_description": "sync idempotency test (retry)" }
   ```
   ```http
   GET /api/now/table/[incident](../incident/SKILL.md)?sysparm_query=correlation_id=PD-INC-VALIDATION-TEST
   ```
   A result with more than one record confirms the sync flow inserts
   unconditionally rather than checking-then-updating — this is a
   structural bug, not an edge case, since both PagerDuty and Opsgenie
   retry webhook deliveries on transient failures as standard behavior.

7. **Check for a bidirectional sync loop** by making a status change on
   one side (ServiceNow) and confirming it doesn't bounce back and forth
   with the paging tool indefinitely — a single test transition should
   settle to a stable state within one or two round trips, not oscillate:
   ```http
   PATCH /api/now/table/[incident](../incident/SKILL.md)/<TEST_INCIDENT_SYS_ID>
   { "incident_state": "6" }
   ```
   Monitor the linked PagerDuty/Opsgenie [incident](../incident/SKILL.md) and the ServiceNow
   record for several minutes afterward — repeated back-and forth status
   flips indicate the sync flow lacks a single source of truth per field
   (see the sync-loop pitfall in
   [servicenow-itsm-integration](../[servicenow-itsm-integration](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/servicenow-itsm-integration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)).

8. **Report findings to a place people actually act on**, not a report
   that sits unread — open a tracked ticket for each gap found (a
   CI with no owner, an approval group with only one active member) and
   assign an owner and a deadline, the same discipline recommended for
   escalation-policy validation findings.

## Best practices

- Validate against *resolved* configuration — the actual current CMDB
  CI-to-group mapping, the actual active membership of an approval
  group — not just the static workflow diagram, which can look correct
  while the underlying data it depends on has quietly drifted.
- Treat "approval group has only one currently-active/reachable member"
  as a hard failure requiring remediation, not a lower-priority
  observation — this is functionally identical to a paging escalation
  policy with no real redundancy.
- Run assignment-routing validation against a representative sample of
  CIs spanning different business units/services, not a single
  known-good example that happens to already be configured correctly.
- Walk every workflow transition for missing outbound paths
  (rejected/cancelled/timed-out, not just the happy "approved" path) —
  a workflow that only handles the success case will strand a real
  record the first time a real approver says no.
- Test sync-flow idempotency and loop behavior deliberately (steps 6-7)
  rather than assuming it works because it hasn't visibly failed yet —
  both PagerDuty and Opsgenie retry webhook deliveries as routine
  behavior, so an insert-always sync flow *will* eventually duplicate a
  record, not just theoretically might.
- Re-run this validation after any CMDB reorganization, approval-group
  membership change, or workflow edit — configuration that was correct
  at initial setup degrades the same way an on-call schedule does, as
  organizational reality moves and the ServiceNow configuration doesn't
  automatically follow.
- Route every finding into a tracked ticket with an owner and deadline —
  a validation script that logs findings nobody reads has the same
  practical value as not running it.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** A newly onboarded service's incidents consistently land
  in a generic "Unassigned" queue instead of the owning team.
  **Fix:** The service's CMDB CI either doesn't exist yet or has no
  `cmdb_rel_ci` "Owns" relationship configured (step 1) — this is a
  CMDB data-quality gap to close at service-onboarding time, and should
  be a required checklist item before a new service is considered
  production-ready, not discovered reactively.

- **Symptom:** During an actual Sev1, an Emergency Change sits waiting
  for approval for well over an hour because the one person in the
  "emergency-cab-approvers" group who's actually still active happens
  to be unreachable.
  **Fix:** This is exactly the single-point-of-failure condition step 3
  checks for — [audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md) approval-group membership for active, currently-
  reachable members (not just group size) on a recurring basis, and
  require at least two genuinely independent, reachable approvers
  before depending on the group during a real [incident](../incident/SKILL.md).

- **Symptom:** A workflow gets stuck in "Awaiting Approval" indefinitely
  after a real approver clicks "Reject," because the workflow has no
  transition defined for the rejected case.
  **Fix:** Walk every workflow state for a complete set of outbound
  transitions (step 5) — approved, rejected, cancelled, timed out — as
  a required check before the workflow goes live, not something
  discovered the first time a real approver actually rejects a request.

- **Symptom:** A retried PagerDuty webhook delivery creates a second,
  duplicate ServiceNow [Incident](../incident/SKILL.md) for the same underlying page, and both
  get worked independently by different assignees.
  **Fix:** The sync flow inserts unconditionally instead of checking
  `correlation_id` first (step 6) — this is a structural gap to fix in
  the flow itself (query-then-update, not insert-always), not something
  to work around by manually merging duplicate records after the fact.

- **Symptom:** A ServiceNow [incident](../incident/SKILL.md)'s status flips back and forth
  between states repeatedly right after a status change, generating
  a flood of update notifications.
  **Fix:** The bidirectional sync flow has no single source of truth
  per field/direction (step 7) — assign explicit authority (e.g. the
  paging tool is authoritative while open, ServiceNow becomes
  authoritative only after resolution) and have each sync leg check
  whether the target value already matches before writing.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** Before relying on a newly built Emergency Change workflow
and CMDB-driven routing for the `checkout-team`'s services, the platform
team runs a validation pass.

1. CMDB CI check for `checkout-api`:
   ```http
   GET /api/now/table/cmdb_rel_ci?sysparm_query=parent=<CHECKOUT_API_CI_SYS_ID>^type.name=Owns
   ```
   Returns zero results — `checkout-api`'s CI exists but has no owning-
   group relationship configured. This is filed as a blocking finding:
   incidents against `checkout-api` would currently land in
   "Unassigned." Fix: the relationship is added, `checkout-api` →
   `checkout-team`, and the check is re-run to confirm resolution.

2. Emergency Change approval group check:
   ```http
   GET /api/now/table/sys_user_grmember?sysparm_query=group=<EMERGENCY_CAB_SYS_ID>
   ```
   Returns 5 members; cross-checking each against `sys_user.active`
   shows only 1 is currently active — the other 4 left the company over
   the past year and were never removed from the group. Filed as a
   high-priority finding (functionally a single point of failure); the
   group is repopulated with 3 currently-active, on-call-rostered
   approvers.

3. Test Emergency Change timing (non-production instance):
   ```http
   POST /api/now/table/change_request
   { "type": "emergency", "short_description": "validation test", "justification": "scheduled validation" }
   ```
   First approval action lands at 6 minutes — within the 15-minute
   target SLA, confirming the (now-corrected) approval group's
   notification path works promptly.

4. Workflow transition walk confirms the `change_request` Emergency
   workflow has valid transitions for Approved, Rejected, and Cancelled
   states — no dead ends found.

5. Sync idempotency test (step 6) with a duplicate `correlation_id`
   confirms only one [Incident](../incident/SKILL.md) record is created — the flow's
   check-then-update logic (built per
   [servicenow-itsm-integration](../[servicenow-itsm-integration](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/servicenow-itsm-integration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md))
   is working as designed.

Both blocking findings (CI ownership gap, single-active-approver group)
are filed as tracked tickets with owners and a one-week deadline before
`checkout-team`'s services are considered validated for reliance on the
Emergency Change path.
