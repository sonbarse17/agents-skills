# Release Versioning and Changelog Automation

## Purpose

A version number is a promise: consumers of a library, API, or service use
it to decide whether an upgrade is safe. When versioning is inconsistent
(manually chosen, disconnected from what actually changed) or changelogs
are stale/hand-written-after-the-fact, that promise breaks — consumers
either upgrade blindly into a breaking change or avoid upgrading at all
out of distrust. This skill covers deriving version numbers and changelogs
automatically and consistently from [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) history, so every release
carries an accurate, machine-verifiable account of what changed and how
risky the upgrade is.

## When to use

- Establishing a versioning scheme for a new library, service, or API
  (SemVer vs. CalVer, and why).
- Automating changelog generation from [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) messages instead of
  hand-writing release notes after the fact (or not at all).
- Setting up automatic release tagging/publishing triggered by merges to
  the main branch.
- A consumer asks "what changed between v1.3.0 and v1.4.0" and there's no
  reliable answer beyond reading the full [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) log.
- Enforcing Conventional Commits (or another structured [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) format) so
  automation has something reliable to parse.
- Coordinating version bumps across a [monorepo](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Frontend/monorepo/SKILL.md) with multiple
  independently-versioned packages.

## Prerequisites & environment

- A [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) message convention the team will actually follow —
  Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `feat!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE:`,
  `chore:`, etc.) is the most common because tooling (semantic-release,
  release-please, commitlint) is built around it, but any structured
  format works if it distinguishes breaking/feature/fix changes.
- Node.js ≥ 18 if using `semantic-release` (npm package, but works for
  any language's release artifact, not just JS); or `release-please` (Go
  binary/[GitHub](../../CI_CD/github/SKILL.md) Action, language-agnostic) as an alternative with a
  slightly different model (it opens a standing "Release PR" that
  accumulates changes, rather than releasing on every merge).
- Git tag push permission for the CI identity, and, if publishing to a
  package registry as part of the release, registry publish credentials
  scoped to the release job only (see
  [artifact-and-dependency-management](../[artifact-and-dependency-management](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Frontend/artifact-and-[dependency-management](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/dependency-management/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)).
- A decision on SemVer vs. CalVer before automating: SemVer
  (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) suits libraries/APIs where consumers reason about
  compatibility; CalVer (`YYYY.MM.PATCH` or similar) suits products/
  services released on a cadence where "compatibility" is less the point
  than "when was this built."
- `commitlint` (or equivalent) wired into CI/pre-[commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) if you want
  malformed [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) messages caught before they break automated version
  inference, rather than discovered at release time.

## Step-by-step guidance

1. **Adopt Conventional Commits** as the structured input automation will
   parse:
   ```
   feat(auth): add OAuth2 device code flow
   fix(billing): correct rounding in tax calculation
   feat(api)!: remove deprecated /v1/users endpoint

   BREAKING CHANGE: /v1/users is removed; use /v2/users instead.
   ```
   `feat` → minor bump, `fix` → patch bump, `!`/`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
   → major bump. Enforce format with `commitlint` in a [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md)-msg hook or
   CI check so bad commits are caught at PR time, not discovered when a
   release computes the wrong version.

2. **Configure semantic-release** for "release on every merge to main"
   model:
   ```json
   {
     "branches": ["main"],
     "plugins": [
       "@semantic-release/[commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md)-analyzer",
       "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
       "@semantic-release/changelog",
       ["@semantic-release/npm", { "npmPublish": true }],
       "@semantic-release/[github](../../CI_CD/github/SKILL.md)",
       ["@semantic-release/git", {
         "assets": ["CHANGELOG.md", "package.json"],
         "message": "chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]"
       }]
     ]
   }
   ```
   Run it as a dedicated CI job after tests pass on `main`:
   ```yaml
   release:
     needs: [verify]
     if: [github](../../CI_CD/github/SKILL.md).ref == 'refs/heads/main'
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     permissions: { contents: write, issues: write, pull-requests: write }
     steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         with: { fetch-depth: 0 }
       - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
         with: { node-version: "20" }
       - run: npx semantic-release
         env:
           GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
           NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
   ```
   `fetch-depth: 0` is required — semantic-release needs full [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md)
   history to compute the next version, not a shallow clone.

3. **Or configure release-please** for a "standing release PR" model,
   which is often easier to review before anything ships (the PR itself
   *is* the changelog preview):
   ```yaml
   - uses: googleapis/release-please-action@v4
     with:
       release-type: node
       target-branch: main
   ```
   Every merge to `main` updates a long-lived "chore(main): release
   1.5.0" PR with the accumulated changelog; merging that PR is what
   actually cuts the tag/release. This suits teams wanting a deliberate
   "yes, ship this batch" moment rather than releasing on every merge.

4. **For a [monorepo](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Frontend/monorepo/SKILL.md) with multiple independently-versioned packages**, use
   a tool that understands package boundaries — `semantic-release` with
   `semantic-release-[monorepo](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Frontend/monorepo/SKILL.md)` extensions, `release-please`'s manifest
   mode, or Changesets (common in JS monorepos: contributors add a small
   `.changeset/*.md` describing the change and bump type per affected
   package, and a bot batches them into per-package releases).

5. **Publish the changelog and artifact together, atomically.** The
   release job should tag Git, generate/[commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) `CHANGELOG.md`, publish
   the package/image (pinned to that exact version — see
   [container-build-and-release](../[container-build-and-release](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/container-build-and-release/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)),
   and create the [GitHub](../../CI_CD/github/SKILL.md)/GitLab release entry as one coordinated job —
   not as separate manual steps that can drift out of sync (e.g., a tag
   exists but the changelog wasn't updated, or vice versa).

6. **Surface breaking changes prominently**, not buried mid-changelog.
   Most changelog generators already group by type (Features, Bug Fixes,
   BREAKING CHANGES) — verify the `BREAKING CHANGES` section renders
   first/most visibly in the generated notes, since that's the section
   consumers most need before upgrading.

## Best practices

- Never hand-edit a version number that automation also manages — pick
  one source of truth (the tool) or you get drift between what's tagged
  in Git and what's declared in the manifest (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`).
- Treat the [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) message, not the PR title alone, as the thing
  automation parses (unless your tool is explicitly configured to use
  squash-merge PR titles) — decide which and be consistent, since a team
  that writes good PR titles but sloppy [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) messages (or vice versa)
  will get inconsistent changelogs depending on which one the tool reads.
- Reserve manual/human-chosen version numbers for pre-1.0 or experimental
  packages where SemVer's compatibility promise doesn't yet apply
  (`0.x.y` releases are conventionally allowed to break on minor bumps) —
  document that explicitly so consumers aren't misled.
- Keep the changelog itself in the repo (`CHANGELOG.md`), not only in a
  release platform's UI, so it's versioned alongside the code and
  diffable across releases.
- Gate a release job behind the same passing test suite used for regular
  CI (per
  [ci-cd-pipeline-design](../[ci-cd-pipeline-design](../../CI_CD/ci-cd-pipeline-design/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)) — release
  automation should never bypass quality gates just because it's a
  separate job.
- For CalVer schemes, still record a monotonically increasing patch/build
  component (`2026.07.3`) so two releases in the same period remain
  orderable, and still generate a changelog — CalVer solves "when," not
  "what changed."

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** semantic-release computes a version bump that doesn't
  match what the team expected (e.g., a release that should have been
  major only bumps minor).
  **Fix:** Check the actual [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) messages since the last release for
  the `!`/`BREAKING CHANGE:` marker — a breaking change described only in
  prose without the structured marker will not be detected as breaking by
  the [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md)-analyzer plugin, regardless of how the PR description reads.

- **Symptom:** The changelog and the published package version disagree
  (changelog says 1.5.0, but the published package is still 1.4.2).
  **Fix:** The release steps ran out of order or partially failed — make
  tagging, changelog [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md), and publish part of one atomic job/plugin
  chain (as semantic-release's plugin pipeline does) rather than separate
  jobs that can fail independently and leave things half-updated.

- **Symptom:** A squash-merged PR's [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) message on `main` is just the
  PR title, losing the granular Conventional [Commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md) messages from
  individual commits within the PR.
  **Fix:** Decide deliberately whether squash-merge is compatible with
  your setup — if squashing, enforce that the *PR title itself* follows
  Conventional Commits format (many teams add a `commitlint`/PR-title-lint
  check specifically for this), since that becomes the only [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md)
  message automation ever sees.

- **Symptom:** `semantic-release` runs but produces no release at all,
  with no clear error.
  **Fix:** Confirm the checkout step used `fetch-depth: 0` (full history)
  — a shallow clone frequently causes the [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md)-analyzer to see no
  releasable commits since it can't walk back to the last tag.

- **Symptom:** Consumers of a library keep getting broken by "minor"
  version bumps.
  **Fix:** [Audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md) recent releases for commits marked `feat` that actually
  removed or changed existing behavior without a `!`/`BREAKING CHANGE:`
  marker — this is a [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md)-discipline problem, not a tooling problem;
  retrain contributors (and consider a PR template reminder) on when a
  change is actually breaking under SemVer.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** `payments-api` uses semantic-release on every merge to
`main`. Three PRs merge in sequence:

1. `fix(billing): correct rounding in tax calculation` → merges, triggers
   release: `1.4.1` → `1.4.2`. Changelog gets a new "Bug Fixes" entry.
2. `feat(webhooks): add support for retry-after header` → merges,
   triggers release: `1.4.2` → `1.5.0`. Changelog gets a "Features" entry.
3. `feat(api)!: remove deprecated /v1/users endpoint` with a
   `BREAKING CHANGE: /v1/users removed; use /v2/users.` footer → merges,
   triggers release: `1.5.0` → `2.0.0`. The generated `CHANGELOG.md`
   places a `BREAKING CHANGES` section at the top of the `2.0.0` entry.

Resulting `CHANGELOG.md` excerpt:
```markdown
## [2.0.0](.../compare/v1.5.0...v2.0.0) (2026-07-28)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES
* **api:** /v1/users is removed; use /v2/users instead.

### Features
* **api:** remove deprecated /v1/users endpoint

## [1.5.0](.../compare/v1.4.2...v1.5.0) (2026-07-20)

### Features
* **webhooks:** add support for retry-after header

## [1.4.2](.../compare/v1.4.1...v1.4.2) (2026-07-18)

### Bug Fixes
* **billing:** correct rounding in tax calculation
```
Each release is tagged in Git (`v2.0.0`, etc.), the container image is
built and pushed with the matching immutable tag (see
[container-build-and-release](../[container-build-and-release](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/container-build-and-release/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)),
and consumers evaluating the upgrade from `1.5.0` to `2.0.0` can see
immediately, from the changelog alone, that a breaking API removal is
involved — without reading a single raw [commit](../../CI_CD/commit/SKILL.md).
