# Liquibase Advanced Changelog Management and Rollback Strategies

## Purpose

[database-schema-migration-with-liquibase-and-flyway](../[database-schema-migration-with-liquibase-and-flyway](../database-schema-migration-with-liquibase-and-flyway/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
covers the basics of Liquibase changesets and when to make them
reversible — this skill picks up where that leaves off, for a Liquibase
deployment that has matured past "a handful of changesets" into a
long-lived project with many contributors, multiple environments, and
changes that need environment-specific targeting or genuinely custom
rollback logic Liquibase can't auto-generate. It covers **contexts** and
**labels** (Liquibase's two, distinct mechanisms for controlling which
changesets apply where), writing **custom rollback** blocks for
non-trivial forward changes, and changelog organization patterns that
keep a large, multi-team changelog navigable and safe rather than a
single ever-growing file nobody fully understands.

## When to use

- A changeset needs to apply only in specific environments (e.g. seed
  data for staging/dev, but never production) or only for a specific
  release/feature rollout, and a single shared changelog needs to
  express that without maintaining separate changelog files per
  environment.
- Writing a rollback for a changeset whose forward operation Liquibase
  cannot auto-generate a rollback for (a data transformation, a
  non-trivial `sql` changeset, a stored-procedure change).
- The changelog has grown to the point where a single large XML/YAML
  file is unwieldy, or multiple teams contribute changesets and need a
  structure that avoids merge conflicts and unclear ownership.
- Auditing whether contexts/labels are actually being applied as
  intended (`liquibase status`, `liquibase history`) after a confusing
  deploy where an unexpected changeset ran (or didn't run) in a given
  environment.
- Designing changelog structure and rollback policy for a new,
  large-scale Liquibase adoption from the start, rather than retrofitting
  structure onto an already-sprawling changelog later.

## Prerequisites & environment

- Working familiarity with basic Liquibase changesets, the
  `DATABASECHANGELOG` tracking table, and the forward-only-vs-reversible
  decision already covered in
  [database-schema-migration-with-liquibase-and-flyway](../[database-schema-migration-with-liquibase-and-flyway](../database-schema-migration-with-liquibase-and-flyway/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md) —
  this skill does not re-explain those basics.
- Liquibase 4.x assumed for the syntax below; contexts and labels are
  both available since early Liquibase 3.x/4.x but label expression
  syntax (`labels: "!prod-only"` style boolean expressions) is a 4.x
  feature — verify syntax compatibility if working against an older
  Liquibase version.
- A defined, agreed set of environment names/contexts and label
  conventions **before** they're used across many changesets — an
  ungoverned, ad hoc set of context strings (`"staging"`, `"stage"`,
  `"Staging"` used inconsistently by different contributors) silently
  fails to filter as intended, since context matching is exact-string,
  not fuzzy.
- CI/CD pipeline configuration capable of passing the correct
  `--contexts`/`--label-filter` flag per target environment at deploy
  time — the filtering only works if the deploy pipeline actually
  specifies it; running `liquibase update` with no context flag applies
  **every** changeset regardless of its context, which is rarely the
  intended behavior for a context-scoped changeset.

## Step-by-step guidance

### 1. Use contexts for environment/purpose targeting, and understand exact-match semantics

```xml
<changeSet id="42" author="team" context="staging,dev">
  <insert tableName="feature_flags">
    <column name="name" value="new_checkout_flow"/>
    <column name="enabled" value="true"/>
  </insert>
</changeSet>
```
```bash
liquibase update --contexts=staging
```
A changeset with `context="staging,dev"` runs when the deploy's
`--contexts` flag includes **either** `staging` or `dev` (comma-separated
contexts within one changeset are OR'd) — but the match itself is an
exact string comparison. `--contexts=staging` will not match a
changeset tagged `context="Staging"` or `context="stage"` — there is no
fuzzy matching, no case normalization guaranteed across all versions,
and this is the most common cause of "why didn't this changeset run"
confusion. Establish and document a small, fixed vocabulary of context
names used consistently across the whole team before contexts proliferate.

Liquibase 4.x also supports boolean context expressions for more
precise targeting:
```xml
<changeSet id="43" author="team" context="staging and not smoke-test">
```

### 2. Use labels for cross-cutting classification, distinct from contexts

Labels and contexts solve related but distinct problems: contexts are
typically environment/purpose-scoped ("run this in staging"), while
labels are better suited to cross-cutting classification that doesn't
map to a specific environment ("this changeset is part of release
2026.3" or "this changeset requires a maintenance window"):
```xml
<changeSet id="44" author="team" labels="release-2026.3,requires-downtime">
  <dropColumn tableName="orders" columnName="legacy_status"/>
</changeSet>
```
```bash
liquibase update --label-filter="release-2026.3"
```
A common, effective pattern combines both: contexts gate *where* a
changeset can run, labels classify *what kind* of change it is for
reporting/auditing/selective-rollout purposes — e.g. running only the
changesets for a specific release that are also safe for the current
environment: `--contexts=production --label-filter=release-2026.3`.

### 3. Write custom rollback for changes Liquibase can't auto-generate

Liquibase can auto-generate a rollback for simple, structurally
reversible changes (e.g. `addColumn` → `dropColumn`), but cannot for
data transformations, most `sql`/`sqlFile` changesets, or anything
whose forward operation isn't a pure structural inverse:
```xml
<changeSet id="45" author="team">
  <sql>
    UPDATE orders SET status = 'archived' WHERE created_at < '2024-01-01' AND status = 'completed';
  </sql>
  <rollback>
    UPDATE orders SET status = 'completed' WHERE created_at < '2024-01-01' AND status = 'archived';
  </rollback>
</changeSet>
```
This rollback is only a *correct* inverse because the forward
operation's `WHERE` clause was specific enough that no other process
could have set matching rows to `'archived'` for a different reason in
the interim — a custom rollback is only as trustworthy as the
reasoning behind why it's a true inverse of the specific forward
change, not a generic-looking undo. For a genuinely irreversible
forward operation (a `DROP COLUMN` that deletes data, a destructive bulk
delete), write an explicit `empty` rollback with a comment explaining
why, rather than a rollback block that looks complete but can't restore
lost data:
```xml
<changeSet id="46" author="team">
  <dropColumn tableName="orders" columnName="legacy_notes"/>
  <rollback>
    <!-- Intentionally irreversible: legacy_notes data is not recoverable
         from this rollback. Restore from backup if this change needs
         to be undone. See [database-[backup-and-restore](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Frontend/backup-and-restore/SKILL.md)-strategies](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Databases/database-[backup-and-restore](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Frontend/backup-and-restore/SKILL.md)-strategies/SKILL.md). -->
  </rollback>
</changeSet>
```
An explicit, documented empty rollback is safer than either an
auto-generated rollback that silently can't restore data, or no
`<rollback>` block at all (which causes `liquibase rollback` to fail
outright when it reaches this changeset, potentially mid-rollback-chain
during an [incident](../incident/SKILL.md) when clarity matters most).

### 4. Organize a large changelog with includeAll and per-feature/per-team files

```xml
<!-- db.changelog-master.xml -->
<databaseChangeLog>
  <includeAll path="changelogs/2025/" relativeToChangelogFile="true"/>
  <includeAll path="changelogs/2026/" relativeToChangelogFile="true"/>
</databaseChangeLog>
```
```
changelogs/
├── 2025/
│   ├── 001-create-orders-table.xml
│   └── 002-add-orders-status-index.xml
└── 2026/
    ├── 001-add-payment-method-column.xml
    └── 002-archive-legacy-orders.xml
```
`includeAll` processes files in a directory in (by default) alphabetical
order — a strict, predictable naming convention (a numeric or
date-based prefix) is what makes ordering deterministic and mergeable
across contributors working in parallel branches; without one, two
concurrently-authored files can merge cleanly in git but apply in an
unintended relative order. For a genuinely large multi-team project,
splitting by year/quarter (as above) or by service/schema-owning team
keeps individual files small and reduces merge conflicts on a single
shared master file, while `includeAll`'s directory scan keeps the master
changelog itself simple and rarely needing edits.

### 5. [Audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md) what actually applied, and why, when a deploy's behavior is confusing

```bash
liquibase status --contexts=staging
liquibase history
```
```sql
SELECT id, author, filename, dateexecuted, contexts, labels
FROM databasechangelog
ORDER BY dateexecuted DESC LIMIT 20;
```
`DATABASECHANGELOG` records the `contexts`/`labels` a changeset was
tagged with *at the time it ran*, which is the ground truth for "why did
(or didn't) this changeset apply here" — check this table directly
rather than only re-reading the changelog source, since the changelog
file may have been edited since (a changeset's tag metadata, unlike its
checksummed content, doesn't retroactively change what already ran).

## Best practices

- Document a fixed, small vocabulary of context names and label
  conventions before they proliferate — exact-string matching means an
  inconsistent vocabulary silently breaks filtering with no error.
- Use contexts for "where does this run" and labels for "what kind of
  change is this," and combine both in CI/CD deploy commands rather than
  overloading one mechanism to do both jobs.
- Never leave a genuinely irreversible forward changeset without a
  `<rollback>` block — write an explicit, documented empty rollback
  rather than letting `liquibase rollback` fail unexpectedly mid-chain
  during an [incident](../incident/SKILL.md).
- Validate a hand-written rollback's correctness against the forward
  changeset's actual `WHERE`/scope logic, not just its surface
  resemblance to an "undo" — a rollback that looks plausible but
  matches a broader or narrower row set than the forward change is a
  data-integrity bug waiting to happen.
- Enforce a strict, deterministic file-naming convention for any
  `includeAll`-based changelog structure, and split large changelogs by
  time period or owning team well before a single file becomes
  unmanageable.
- Treat `DATABASECHANGELOG`'s recorded `contexts`/`labels` per applied
  changeset as the [audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md) trail for "what ran where and why," not just
  the current changelog source.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** A changeset tagged for a specific environment runs
  anyway during a deploy that wasn't supposed to include it (or,
  conversely, doesn't run when expected).
  **Fix:** Context matching is exact-string — a typo or inconsistent
  casing (`"Staging"` vs. `"staging"`) between the changeset's `context`
  attribute and the deploy's `--contexts` flag silently fails to match
  with no error raised. [Audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md) `DATABASECHANGELOG.contexts` for the
  actual recorded value against the deploy pipeline's actual flag value,
  and standardize on a documented, enforced vocabulary going forward.

- **Symptom:** `liquibase rollback` fails partway through a multi-
  changeset rollback chain, referencing a changeset with no rollback
  defined.
  **Fix:** A changeset (often one added later, without following the
  team's rollback-authoring convention) has no `<rollback>` block at
  all, and Liquibase has no auto-generatable inverse for its operation.
  Add an explicit rollback (real or documented-empty) for every
  changeset as it's authored — discovering a missing rollback mid-
  [incident](../incident/SKILL.md), with a rollback chain already partially applied, is the
  worst time to write one.

- **Symptom:** A rollback that "looks correct" is run, and it restores
  the wrong rows, or too many/too few rows compared to what the forward
  changeset actually changed.
  **Fix:** The rollback's `WHERE`/scope logic doesn't precisely mirror
  the forward changeset's actual scope (e.g. the forward change had an
  additional filter condition the rollback's inverse omitted). Review a
  custom rollback's exact predicate logic against the forward
  changeset's, not just its general shape, and test the rollback
  against a copy of the same data state the forward changeset was
  tested against.

- **Symptom:** Two contributors' changesets, each individually correct
  and merged cleanly in version control, apply in an unexpected relative
  order in a shared environment, and the second one fails because it
  assumed the first had already run.
  **Fix:** `includeAll`'s directory-scan ordering (typically
  alphabetical) doesn't guarantee the order two concurrently-authored
  files were *intended* to run in unless a strict, enforced naming
  convention (numeric/date prefix) makes that order unambiguous and
  git-mergeable. Adopt and enforce such a convention, and validate the
  full changelog's actual apply order in CI against a fresh database
  before merge — consistent with the CI validation discipline in
  [database-schema-migration-with-liquibase-and-flyway](../[database-schema-migration-with-liquibase-and-flyway](../database-schema-migration-with-liquibase-and-flyway/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

- **Symptom:** Someone runs `liquibase rollback-count 5` (or an
  equivalent bulk rollback) directly against production during an
  [incident](../incident/SKILL.md), without first confirming each of those five changesets'
  rollback definitions are genuinely safe and reversible.
  **Fix:** A bulk rollback applies every changeset's `<rollback>` block
  in reverse order without individually re-confirming each one is a true
  data-preserving inverse — if even one of those five includes a
  documented-irreversible empty rollback (or, worse, an incorrect
  auto-generated one for a change that wasn't truly reversible), the
  bulk rollback silently doesn't restore what someone assumes it does.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** A payments platform's Liquibase changelog has grown to
over 300 changesets in a single flat XML file across three teams, with
recurring confusion about which changesets are safe to run in staging
versus production, and a recent [incident](../incident/SKILL.md) where a rollback failed
partway through because an older changeset had no rollback defined.

1. Restructure the changelog by year and owning team, converting the
   flat file into an `includeAll`-based structure with a strict
   `NNN-description.xml` naming convention per directory, validated in
   CI to apply cleanly in the enforced order against a fresh database.
2. Establish and document a fixed context vocabulary
   (`production`, `staging`, `dev`) and a separate label convention for
   release tracking (`release-YYYY.Q`), auditing the existing 300
   changesets for inconsistent context strings (finds several instances
   of `"Staging"` and `"stage"` that had been silently not matching
   `--contexts=staging` deploys) and correcting them.
3. [Audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md) all 300 changesets for missing `<rollback>` blocks; for
   genuinely irreversible ones (a handful of historical `DROP COLUMN`
   operations), add explicit documented-empty rollbacks referencing the
   team's backup/restore [runbook](../runbook/SKILL.md) instead of leaving them undefined.
4. For the specific data-transformation changeset (an `UPDATE`
   archiving old orders) whose rollback had caused the recent [incident](../incident/SKILL.md),
   rewrite its rollback to precisely mirror the forward changeset's
   `WHERE` clause, and add a test in CI that applies the changeset,
   applies the rollback, and asserts the resulting data state exactly
   matches the pre-changeset state.
5. Update the CI/CD pipeline to always pass explicit `--contexts` and
   `--label-filter` flags per environment (never relying on the
   default, unfiltered `liquibase update`), and add a pre-deploy check
   that fails the pipeline if any changeset in the current release's
   label has no rollback defined.
6. Document the new context/label vocabulary and rollback-authoring
   requirement in the team's contribution guide, closing the gap that
   allowed the original inconsistency to accumulate.
