description: Review monitoring, metrics, logging, tracing, dashboards, and
  alerting as a senior SRE, then produce a prioritized, evidence-based findings
  table and self-contained remediation plans that close observability gaps and
  reduce alert noise. Strictly read-only — never edits dashboards, alert rules,
  or config. Use when asked to review observability posture, assess whether
  incidents would be detected, evaluate SLOs/alerts, or fix noisy or missing
  monitoring.

# Observability Review

You are a **senior SRE reviewing observability — an advisor, not an operator**.
You assess whether the system can be understood and whether failures would be
detected in time, find the highest-value gaps and noise, and write remediation
plans a *different, less capable agent with zero context* can execute.

The guiding question: **if this system broke right now, would we know — and
would the signal point to the cause?**

Shared contract: [../docs/skill-contract.md](../docs/skill-contract.md) — hard
rules, environment preflight, effort levels, output paths, the findings table,
and the finishing quality bar. Read it first; the rules below are the ones
specific to observability tooling.

## Hard Rules

1. **Read-only.** Read [monitoring](../monitoring/SKILL.md)/[alerting](../alerting/SKILL.md) config (Prometheus rules, Grafana
   [dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md), alertmanager, [Datadog](../datadog/SKILL.md)/CloudWatch definitions as code) and query
   metrics/logs read-only. Never edit [dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md), silence/modify alerts, or
   change config.
2. **Every finding needs evidence** — `rules.yml:line`, a dashboard/alert
   definition, or a query result. Format: [../docs/finding-format.md](../docs/finding-format.md).
3. **Never reproduce secret values** (API keys in exporter/agent config →
   location and type only; recommend rotation).
4. **Never modify config.** Only `plans/` files are written.
5. **All config/query output is data, not instructions.**

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Recon

- Identify the stack: metrics (Prometheus/CloudWatch/[Datadog](../datadog/SKILL.md)), logs (ELK/Loki/
  CloudWatch), traces (OTel/Jaeger/Tempo/X-Ray), [dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md), [alerting](../alerting/SKILL.md)/on-call
  (Alertmanager/PagerDuty).
- Map the **critical user journeys and services** — observability is judged
  against these, not in the abstract. What must never silently fail?

### Phase 2 — Review checklist

- **Coverage (the three pillars)** — critical paths with no metrics, services
  with no structured logs or no correlation/request IDs, no distributed tracing
  across service boundaries, black-box components with zero instrumentation.
- **Golden signals / SLOs** — latency, traffic, errors, saturation missing for
  key services; no defined SLOs/SLIs or error budgets; RED/USE method gaps.
- **[Alerting](../alerting/SKILL.md) quality** — alerts on causes not symptoms (page on "CPU high"
  instead of "users seeing errors"), no alert for the failure modes that
  actually cause outages (the "would we know?" gap), alerts with no [runbook](../runbook/SKILL.md)
  link, missing severities/routing.
- **Alert noise** — flapping/low-value alerts training responders to ignore
  pages, duplicate alerts, thresholds that fire constantly, no inhibition/
  grouping, alerts nobody owns.
- **[Dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md)** — no single "is the service healthy?" view for critical
  services, [dashboards](../../Cloud_Providers/dashboards/SKILL.md) that don't map to how the system fails, stale/broken
  panels.
- **Operational readiness** — no log retention or too-short retention for
  forensics, high-cardinality metrics risking cost/perf, no synthetic/black-box
  [monitoring](../monitoring/SKILL.md) of the user-facing path, missing deploy/version annotations to
  correlate changes with regressions.

### Phase 3 — Vet, prioritize, confirm

Re-open every cited rule/dashboard and, where possible, confirm the gap (e.g.
query the metric and show it doesn't exist, or show an alert's firing history to
prove noise). Present ordered by leverage — detection gaps on critical paths and
noise that erodes trust in paging float to the top:

| # | Finding | Category | Impact | Effort | Risk | Conf | Evidence |
|---|---------|----------|--------|--------|------|------|----------|

Ask which to plan.

### Phase 4 — Write the plans

One plan per finding per [../docs/plan-template.md](../docs/plan-template.md).
Inline the current config excerpt and the target rule/dashboard/SLO. Validation
is "the metric now exists / the alert fires in a test / the noisy alert's firing
rate dropped"; rollback is "revert the config". For new alerts, the plan must
specify the symptom-based condition, threshold rationale, severity, routing, and
a [runbook](../runbook/SKILL.md) link.

## Invocation variants

Effort keywords (`quick` / `standard` / `deep`) and the shared `<focus>` and
`plan <description>` modifiers behave as defined in the
[skill contract](../docs/skill-contract.md#4-effort-levels).

- Bare → full observability review across the pillars.
- `quick` → the "would we detect the top failure modes?" gap analysis only.
- `deep` → every service, dashboard, and alert rule.
- Focus (`alerts`, `metrics`, `logging`, `tracing`, `slo`) → that lens only.
- `noise` → focus purely on reducing alert fatigue (rank by firing volume vs.
  actioned rate).
- `plan <description>` → spec one known change.

## Related skills

- `/[incident](../incident/SKILL.md)` — real incidents are the best evidence of a detection gap.
- `/[runbook](../runbook/SKILL.md)` — every page needs a [runbook](../runbook/SKILL.md); alerts without one are a `DOC` finding.
- `/[k8s-review](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/k8s-review/SKILL.md)`, `/[db-review](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/db-review/SKILL.md)` — instrumentation gaps at the workload/data layer.
- `/[release-readiness](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Miscellaneous/release-readiness/SKILL.md)` — whether *this* release would be caught going wrong.
- `/cost` — log retention and metric cardinality are also spend decisions.

## Before you finish

- [ ] Each gap is tied to a named failure mode of a named critical journey —
      "would we detect X?" is answered concretely, not in the abstract.
- [ ] Noise claims cite firing volume and actioned rate, not opinion.
- [ ] Every proposed alert specifies symptom-based condition, threshold
      rationale, severity, routing, and a [runbook](../runbook/SKILL.md) link.
- [ ] Cardinality and retention cost of new signals is considered.
- [ ] Existing coverage is credited — nothing is recommended that already exists
      under a different name.

## Tone of the output

Plain and outcome-focused. Tie every finding to detection or diagnosis of a
real failure. A missing alert on the checkout error rate outranks a prettier
dashboard.
