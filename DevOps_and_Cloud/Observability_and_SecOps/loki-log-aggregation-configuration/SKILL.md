# Loki Log Aggregation Configuration

## Purpose

Loki indexes only a small label set per log stream and stores the log
content itself as compressed chunks in object storage — a deliberate
design trade-off (cheap to run at scale, versus Elasticsearch's
full-text index) that only pays off if labels are chosen with
cardinality discipline and ingestion limits/retention are configured for
real volume, not left at chart defaults. This skill covers configuring
Loki itself as the aggregation backend: label/cardinality design,
`limits_config` ingestion controls, the schema/chunk store config that
determines the index format and storage backend, retention, and
deployment-mode selection — not the queries run against it (see
[logql-query-authoring](../[logql-query-authoring](../logql-query-authoring/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)) and not
pre-deploy config validation (see
[loki-configuration-validation](../[loki-configuration-validation](../loki-configuration-validation/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)),
which is a distinct, narrower concern from standing up Loki in the first
place.

## When to use

- Standing up a new Loki instance/cluster for log aggregation, choosing
  a deployment mode and storage backend.
- Designing which fields become indexed stream labels versus staying as
  unindexed log content/parsed fields.
- Setting or revising retention (how long logs are kept, and per-tenant
  overrides).
- Loki is rejecting logs at ingestion (`429`/`entry too far behind`/
  `per-stream rate limit exceeded`) or silently dropping expected log
  volume.
- Scaling Loki from a single-binary/small setup to handle materially
  higher log volume, and deciding on simple-scalable vs. [microservices](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Patterns/microservices/SKILL.md)
  deployment mode.
- Migrating or configuring the [object-storage](../../Cloud_Providers/object-storage/SKILL.md) backend (S3/GCS/Azure Blob)
  and the index/chunk schema version that governs it.

## Prerequisites & environment

- Loki 2.9+ assumed (TSDB index format, the current recommended schema,
  became stable/default-recommended from 2.9; earlier `boltdb-shipper`
  schema configs still work but TSDB is preferred for new deployments).
- A deployment target: [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md) (via the `loki` or
  `loki-distributed`/`loki-simple-scalable` Helm charts) or bare
  VMs/containers running the Loki binary directly.
- An object storage backend for anything beyond a small/test setup —
  filesystem storage is fine for a single-node evaluation but is not
  durable or horizontally scalable; S3/GCS/Azure Blob (or an S3-compatible
  store like MinIO) is expected for production.
- A log shipper already forwarding logs into Loki's push API (Promtail,
  the Grafana Agent, or Fluent Bit — see
  [fluent-bit-log-forwarding-configuration](../[fluent-bit-log-forwarding-configuration](../fluent-bit-log-forwarding-configuration/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  for configuring Fluent Bit specifically as that shipper) so there's
  something to ingest while tuning limits.
- For multi-tenant setups: `auth_enabled: true` and a clear tenant-ID
  (`X-Scope-OrgID`) scheme agreed with whatever is pushing logs.

## Step-by-step guidance

1. **Choose a deployment mode deliberately, by volume, not by default.**
   - **Single binary (`-target=all`):** simplest, fine for low volume/dev/
     small production. All components (distributor, ingester, querier,
     etc.) run in one process.
   - **Simple scalable (`-target=read` / `-target=write` / `-target=backend`):**
     splits the read and write paths into independently scaled
     deployments — the right default for most production [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)
     setups once volume grows past what single-binary comfortably
     handles.
   - **[Microservices](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Patterns/microservices/SKILL.md):** every Loki component (distributor, ingester,
     querier, query-frontend, compactor, etc.) scaled independently —
     reserve for genuinely large multi-team/high-volume deployments; it's
     meaningfully more operational surface area than most teams need.

2. **Design labels for cardinality, not convenience, before ingesting
   anything at volume.** Every distinct combination of label values
   creates a separate stream, and Loki's index grows with the number of
   streams, not the number of log lines:
   ```yaml
   # GOOD: bounded, small label set
   labels:
     app: payments-api
     namespace: payments
     env: production
     level: error   # small enumerated set (debug/info/warn/error)

   # BAD: unbounded/high-cardinality labels — never do this
   labels:
     app: payments-api
     request_id: "a1b2c3..."     # unique per request — unbounded
     user_id: "48213"            # unbounded
     pod_ip: "10.2.3.41"         # high cardinality, churns on every restart
   ```
   > **Warning — unbounded cardinality:** a label like `request_id`,
   > `user_id`, `trace_id`, or a raw pod IP explodes the number of
   > streams Loki has to track, degrading ingestion and query performance
   > cluster-wide, not just for whoever added the label. Fields like
   > these belong in the log line content (extracted at query time via
   > `| json`/`| logfmt` — see
   > [logql-query-authoring](../[logql-query-authoring](../logql-query-authoring/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)), never
   > as indexed labels. If unsure whether a label is safe, check its
   > cardinality before it ships broadly (see
   > [loki-configuration-validation](../[loki-configuration-validation](../loki-configuration-validation/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
   > for pre-deploy checks).

3. **Configure ingestion limits in `limits_config` to protect the
   cluster from a runaway/misbehaving shipper**, rather than leaving
   defaults that either reject legitimate traffic or let one bad actor
   overwhelm shared infrastructure:
   ```yaml
   limits_config:
     ingestion_rate_mb: 10          # sustained MB/s per tenant
     ingestion_burst_size_mb: 20    # short burst allowance above the rate
     per_stream_rate_limit: 5MB     # per-stream ingestion rate ceiling
     per_stream_rate_limit_burst: 15MB
     max_streams_per_user: 10000    # hard ceiling on distinct streams per tenant
     max_line_size: 256KB
     reject_old_samples: true
     reject_old_samples_max_age: 168h   # 7 days
   ```
   `max_streams_per_user` is the single most important cardinality
   backstop — set it deliberately based on expected label cardinality
   times expected app/namespace count, not left unbounded.

4. **Set retention explicitly, per tenant if multi-tenant, via the
   compactor** — Loki does not delete old chunks on its own without a
   configured retention policy:
   ```yaml
   compactor:
     working_directory: /loki/compactor
     retention_enabled: true
     delete_request_store: s3

   limits_config:
     retention_period: 720h   # 30 days, cluster default

   # per-tenant override (in runtime overrides config, not limits_config)
   overrides:
     "tenant-payments":
       retention_period: 2160h   # 90 days for a tenant needing longer retention
   ```
   Retention is enforced by the **compactor** component — it must be
   running (and `retention_enabled: true` set) for old chunks to actually
   be deleted; setting `retention_period` alone with the compactor
   disabled leaves chunks accumulating indefinitely in object storage.

5. **Configure the schema and storage backend together** — the schema
   config determines the index format (TSDB is current-recommended) and
   is versioned by date so you can roll forward without rewriting
   historical data:
   ```yaml
   schema_config:
     configs:
       - from: 2024-01-01
         store: tsdb
         object_store: s3
         schema: v13
         index:
           prefix: loki_index_
           period: 24h

   storage_config:
     tsdb_shipper:
       active_index_directory: /loki/tsdb-index
       cache_location: /loki/tsdb-cache
     aws:
       s3: s3://<AWS_REGION>/<S3_BUCKET_NAME>
       s3forcepathstyle: false
   ```
   Adding a new `schema_config.configs` entry with a future `from:` date
   is how you change schema/store version going forward without
   rewriting already-ingested data under the old schema — never edit an
   existing entry's `from:` date retroactively.

6. **Size the ingester's replication and WAL settings for durability**
   in a scaled (non-single-binary) deployment:
   ```yaml
   ingester:
     wal:
       enabled: true
       dir: /loki/wal
     lifecycler:
       ring:
         replication_factor: 3
     chunk_idle_period: 30m
     chunk_target_size: 1572864   # ~1.5MB compressed target per chunk
     max_chunk_age: 2h
   ```
   `replication_factor: 3` (typical) means each stream's data is written
   to 3 ingesters before being acknowledged, so a single ingester pod
   loss doesn't lose in-flight (not-yet-flushed-to-storage) log data;
   the WAL protects against loss during ingester restarts specifically.

7. **Confirm ingestion is actually flowing and within limits** after
   deploying:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://<LOKI>/ready
   curl -s http://<LOKI>/metrics | grep -E 'loki_ingester_streams_created_total|loki_discarded_samples_total'
   ```
   A rising `loki_discarded_samples_total` counter (with a `reason`
   label such as `rate_limited`, `stream_limit`, or `line_too_long`)
   means logs are being silently dropped at ingestion — check that
   reason against the `limits_config` values in step 3 before assuming
   the shipper is misbehaving.

## Best practices

- Treat label design as a schema decision made once, deliberately, up
  front — retrofitting a high-cardinality label out of an already-large
  deployment means a slow migration, not a quick config edit.
- Set `max_streams_per_user` and per-stream rate limits explicitly rather
  than relying on defaults meant for evaluation-scale deployments —
  defaults that are too generous let one misbehaving app degrade the
  shared cluster for everyone.
- Enable the compactor with `retention_enabled: true` from day one, even
  if the initial retention period is generous — discovering retention
  was never actually enforced after months of unbounded storage growth
  is an expensive mistake to unwind.
- Prefer TSDB over the older `boltdb-shipper` index store for any new
  deployment — it has better query performance and is the schema Loki
  development is focused on going forward.
- Choose simple-scalable mode as the default production target on
  [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md) rather than jumping straight to full [microservices](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Patterns/microservices/SKILL.md) mode —
  most teams never need the extra operational surface area
  [microservices](../../../Software_Engineering_and_Other/Patterns/microservices/SKILL.md) mode adds.
- Monitor `loki_discarded_samples_total` by `reason` as a standing
  dashboard panel/alert, not just when someone reports missing logs —
  silent ingestion drops are otherwise invisible until someone notices
  gaps during an actual investigation.
- Validate any schema/limits/label change against
  [loki-configuration-validation](../[loki-configuration-validation](../loki-configuration-validation/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  before deploying — a bad schema config or an overly permissive limit
  is much cheaper to catch pre-deploy than to unwind after ingestion has
  already been running against it.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** Loki's storage (object storage bucket, or local disk in a
  small deployment) grows without bound despite a `retention_period`
  being set in config.
  **Fix:** `retention_period` alone does nothing without the compactor
  running with `retention_enabled: true` and `delete_request_store`
  configured — confirm the compactor component is actually deployed and
  its logs show retention sweeps running, not just that the config value
  exists.

- **Symptom:** A specific application's logs start being rejected with
  `429`/`per-stream rate limit exceeded` shortly after a deploy, even
  though overall log volume looks normal.
  **Fix:** That app likely just started emitting a new high-cardinality
  label (a new field promoted to a label, or a bug causing a unique value
  per pod/request), pushing one stream's rate past
  `per_stream_rate_limit`. Check `loki_discarded_samples_total{reason=
  "per_stream_rate_limit"}` and the app's label set — fix the label
  design at the source rather than raising the limit to accommodate
  runaway cardinality.

- **Symptom:** Loki ingesters intermittently lose recent (not-yet-
  flushed) log data during pod restarts/rolling upgrades.
  **Fix:** The write-ahead log (WAL) wasn't enabled, or its volume isn't
  actually persistent (e.g. backed by ephemeral storage in [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)
  instead of a PersistentVolume). Enable `ingester.wal.enabled: true`
  with a real persistent volume backing `wal.dir`, and confirm
  `replication_factor` is set high enough that a single ingester's loss
  doesn't lose data outright.

- **Symptom:** Query performance degrades badly over time as log volume
  grows, even though ingestion itself keeps up fine.
  **Fix:** Often an artifact of the older `boltdb-shipper` index store
  under sustained high stream counts, or `max_streams_per_user` being set
  far higher than the label design actually needs. Migrate to TSDB via a
  new `schema_config` entry (never edit the old one) and re-[audit](../../../AI_and_Agents/Operations/audit/SKILL.md) label
  cardinality.

- **Symptom:** After adding S3 as the storage backend, existing
  historical logs ingested under the previous (e.g. filesystem or GCS)
  backend become unqueryable.
  **Fix:** A `storage_config`/`object_store` change was made by editing
  the existing `schema_config.configs` entry in place instead of adding a
  new entry with a future `from:` date. Add the new backend as a new
  dated schema config entry so historical data continues to be read from
  its original store while new data lands in the new one.

- **Symptom:** A single noisy tenant/team in a multi-tenant Loki cluster
  degrades query latency for every other tenant.
  **Fix:** Per-tenant `limits_config` overrides weren't set, so one
  tenant's oversized queries/high stream count consume shared querier
  resources. Set per-tenant overrides (query concurrency, max streams,
  ingestion rate) in the runtime overrides config rather than a single
  global limit meant to be "generous enough for everyone."

## Worked example

**Scenario:** Standing up Loki on [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md) in simple-scalable mode for
a multi-team platform, backed by S3, with a 30-day default retention and
a stricter cardinality ceiling after an earlier [incident](../incident/SKILL.md) where a team's
new field caused stream-count explosion.

```yaml
# values.yaml (loki-simple-scalable Helm chart, excerpted)
loki:
  auth_enabled: true
  commonConfig:
    replication_factor: 3
  schemaConfig:
    configs:
      - from: 2026-01-01
        store: tsdb
        object_store: s3
        schema: v13
        index:
          prefix: loki_index_
          period: 24h
  storageConfig:
    aws:
      region: <AWS_REGION>
      bucketnames: <S3_BUCKET_NAME>
  limits_config:
    ingestion_rate_mb: 15
    ingestion_burst_size_mb: 30
    per_stream_rate_limit: 5MB
    per_stream_rate_limit_burst: 15MB
    max_streams_per_user: 5000
    retention_period: 720h
  compactor:
    retention_enabled: true
    delete_request_store: s3

write:
  replicas: 3
read:
  replicas: 3
```

Runtime overrides give the `payments` tenant a longer retention window
for compliance without changing the cluster-wide default:

```yaml
overrides:
  "payments":
    retention_period: 2160h
```

After rollout, `loki_discarded_samples_total{reason="per_stream_rate_
limit"}` is added as a standing Grafana panel per team namespace so a
repeat of the earlier cardinality [incident](../incident/SKILL.md) surfaces immediately instead
of being discovered days later during a query-performance complaint.
