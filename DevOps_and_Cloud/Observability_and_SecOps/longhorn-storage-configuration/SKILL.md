# [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) Storage Configuration

## Purpose

[Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) is a [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md)-native distributed block storage system that
replicates each volume across multiple nodes at the storage layer
itself — no external Ceph cluster, no separate storage appliance —
making it markedly simpler to operate than
[rook-ceph-storage-operations](../[rook-ceph-storage-operations](../rook-ceph-storage-operations/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
when a workload's only requirement is durable, replicated `ReadWriteOnce`
block storage. The tradeoff for that simplicity is scope: [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) does
not provide S3-compatible object storage or a POSIX shared filesystem
the way Ceph's RGW/CephFS do, and its per-volume replication model
(each volume's replicas live on distinct nodes, not on a cluster-wide
placement-group/CRUSH abstraction) is architecturally different from
Ceph's. This skill covers installing [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md), configuring replica
count/data locality/scheduling, and setting up snapshot/backup targets;
choosing between [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) and Rook-Ceph in the first place is covered in
the Best practices section below and in
[rook-ceph-storage-operations](../[rook-ceph-storage-operations](../rook-ceph-storage-operations/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)'s
Purpose section.

## When to use

- Providing dynamically-provisioned, replicated block storage on a
  [bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md) or on-prem cluster where object storage and shared
  filesystems aren't required.
- Choosing between [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) and Rook-Ceph for a new cluster's storage
  layer.
- Configuring a StorageClass's replica count or data-locality setting to
  balance durability against I/O latency for a specific workload.
- Setting up scheduled snapshots and off-cluster backups (to S3 or NFS)
  for [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) volumes.
- Recovering a volume after the node it was scheduled on fails, or
  rebuilding a degraded replica.
- Migrating stateful workloads that need only RWO block storage off a
  more operationally heavy Rook-Ceph deployment.

## Prerequisites & environment

- [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md) ≥ 1.25 and [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) ≥ v1.6 (check [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)'s own release
  compatibility matrix — [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) moves its supported [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md) range
  forward fairly aggressively).
- `open-iscsi` (or the distro equivalent) installed and the `iscsid`
  service running on every node that will host [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) volumes —
  [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)'s data path depends on iSCSI, and a missing/stopped `iscsid`
  is the most common install-time blocker.
- At least 3 nodes with free disk space for meaningful replication (the
  same failure-domain reasoning as etcd/Ceph: 3 replicas need at least
  3 independent nodes to actually protect against a single node
  failure).
- The [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) Helm chart or the official manifest, plus `[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md)`/Helm
  access with permission to create the `[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system` namespace and
  its privileged DaemonSets ([Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)'s engine/replica processes need
  host-level block device and iSCSI access).
- A decided backup target (S3-compatible object storage or NFS) before
  going to production — [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)'s built-in replication protects
  against node failure, but not against an accidentally deleted volume
  or a cluster-wide disaster, which only an off-cluster backup target
  covers.

## Step-by-step guidance

1. **Verify prerequisites cluster-wide before installing**:
   ```bash
   [kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)/[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)/v1.6.2/deploy/prerequisite/[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-iscsi-installation.yaml
   [kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) -n [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system get pods -l app=[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-iscsi-installation
   ```
   Confirm every node's iSCSI installation pod completes successfully
   before proceeding — installing [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) itself on top of a node
   missing `open-iscsi` produces engine pods stuck `CrashLoopBackOff`
   with an unhelpful error.

2. **Install [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)** via Helm:
   ```bash
   helm repo add [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) https://charts.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io
   helm install [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)/[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) --namespace [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system --create-namespace --version 1.6.2
   [kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) -n [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system get pods   # wait for all Running
   ```

3. **Define a StorageClass with an explicit replica count and data
   locality**, rather than accepting the chart's default for every
   workload uniformly:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
   kind: StorageClass
   metadata:
     name: [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-replicated
   provisioner: driver.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io
   allowVolumeExpansion: true
   reclaimPolicy: Retain
   parameters:
     numberOfReplicas: "3"
     staleReplicaTimeout: "30"
     dataLocality: "best-effort"
     fromBackup: ""
   ```
   `dataLocality: best-effort` schedules one replica on the same node
   as the workload when possible (lower read latency) without making it
   a hard requirement; `strict-local` forces it (fastest, but the
   volume becomes unschedulable if that specific node is unavailable) —
   choose based on whether latency or scheduling flexibility matters
   more for the workload.

4. **Scope node/disk scheduling explicitly** for heterogeneous
   clusters (e.g. only some nodes have fast local NVMe) via node
   tags and the [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) UI/CRDs, rather than letting every volume
   schedule onto every node uniformly:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io/v1beta2
   kind: Node
   metadata:
     name: worker-1
     namespace: [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system
   spec:
     disks:
       nvme-disk:
         path: /var/lib/[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-nvme
         allowScheduling: true
         tags: ["fast"]
   ```
   Pair with a StorageClass parameter `diskSelector: "fast"` so
   latency-sensitive volumes land only on tagged fast-disk nodes.

5. **Configure a backup target** (S3-compatible or NFS) before any
   volume is considered production-ready — [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)'s replication
   protects against a node failure, not against cluster-wide loss or an
   accidental volume deletion:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-backup-s3-secret
     namespace: [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system
   type: Opaque
   stringData:
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "${LONGHORN_BACKUP_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "${LONGHORN_BACKUP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
   ```
   ```bash
   [kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) -n [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system patch settings.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io backup-target \
     --type=merge -p '{"value":"s3://[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-backups-<ACCOUNT_ID>@us-east-1/"}'
   [kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) -n [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system patch settings.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io backup-target-credential-secret \
     --type=merge -p '{"value":"[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-backup-s3-secret"}'
   ```
   Never place the access key/secret directly in a StorageClass or
   ConfigMap — always reference a [Kubernetes](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubernetes/SKILL.md) Secret, and source the
   Secret's values from your actual secrets manager rather than
   hardcoding them, per
   [secrets-management](../../../[devsecops](../../../Security/devsecops/SKILL.md)/skills/[secrets-management](../../Cloud_Providers/secrets-management/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

6. **Schedule recurring snapshots and backups** via a `RecurringJob`
   rather than relying on manual, ad hoc backup runs:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io/v1beta2
   kind: RecurringJob
   metadata:
     name: daily-backup
     namespace: [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system
   spec:
     cron: "0 2 * * *"
     task: "backup"
     groups: ["default"]
     retain: 7
     concurrency: 2
   ```
   Attach the `RecurringJob` to volumes via the
   `recurring-job.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io/source: enabled` label/group mechanism on
   the PVC, or a StorageClass-level default group, so new volumes are
   covered automatically rather than needing to be manually opted in
   one at a time.

7. **Recover a volume after a node failure** by confirming the volume's
   remaining healthy replicas and letting [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)'s manager reschedule
   the workload/rebuild automatically, verifying rather than assuming:
   ```bash
   [kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) -n [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system get volumes.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io <volume-name> -o jsonpath='{.status.robustness}'
   [kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) -n [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system get replicas.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io -l longhornvolume=<volume-name>
   ```
   `robustness: degraded` (one or more replicas down but the volume
   still serving I/O from remaining healthy replicas) is recoverable
   automatically once the failed node returns or [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) schedules a
   replacement replica elsewhere; `robustness: faulted` (no healthy
   replica remains) requires restoring from the most recent backup —
   see step 8.

8. **Restore a volume from a backup** when no healthy replica survives
   (all replicas were on failed/lost nodes, or a volume was accidentally
   deleted):
   > **Warning:** Restoring creates a new volume from the backup's
   > point-in-time state; any writes to the original volume after that
   > backup was taken are not recoverable this way. Confirm the backup's
   > timestamp against the actual data-loss window before restoring, and
   > restore into a new PVC name rather than overwriting anything that
   > might still hold newer (even if degraded/inaccessible) data.
   ```bash
   [kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) -n [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system get backups.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io -l longhornvolume=<volume-name>
   ```
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: restored-volume
     namespace: payments
   spec:
     accessModes: [ReadWriteOnce]
     storageClassName: [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-replicated
     resources: { requests: { storage: 20Gi } }
     dataSource:
       name: <volumesnapshot-name>
       kind: VolumeSnapshot
       apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
   ```

## Best practices

- Choose [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) over Rook-Ceph when the requirement is purely
  replicated RWO block storage and operational simplicity matters more
  than the broader Ceph feature set (object storage, CephFS, erasure
  coding) — don't default to the heavier system when the lighter one
  fully covers the need.
- Set `numberOfReplicas: 3` (not the frequent default of 2) for
  anything production-facing — 2 replicas means losing one node already
  puts the volume at zero further tolerance, mirroring the etcd/Ceph
  quorum principle.
- Configure and *test* a backup target before considering any
  [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-backed volume production-ready — replication alone does not
  protect against cluster-wide disaster, accidental deletion, or
  corruption that replicates to every replica identically.
- Use `dataLocality: best-effort`, not `disabled`, as the default for
  latency-sensitive workloads unless node-affinity flexibility is more
  important than read latency for that specific volume.
- Tag disks/nodes explicitly (`diskSelector`/`nodeSelector`) in any
  cluster with heterogeneous storage hardware, rather than letting
  [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) schedule replicas onto slow disks for a latency-sensitive
  workload by chance.
- Monitor [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)'s own health via its Prometheus metrics
  (`longhorn_volume_robustness`, `longhorn_node_storage_usage_bytes`)
  through
  [prometheus-and-grafana-[monitoring](../monitoring/SKILL.md)-stack](../../../[observability](../observability/SKILL.md)-and-platform-extras/skills/[prometheus-and-grafana-[monitoring](../monitoring/SKILL.md)-stack](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/prometheus-and-grafana-[monitoring](../monitoring/SKILL.md)-stack/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md)
  rather than only checking the [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) UI reactively.

## Common pitfalls

- **Symptom:** [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) engine/replica pods are stuck
  `CrashLoopBackOff` immediately after install.
  **Fix:** Almost always a missing or stopped `iscsid` on one or more
  nodes — re-run the iSCSI prerequisite installation
  (`[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-iscsi-installation.yaml`) and confirm
  `systemctl status iscsid` is active on every node, not just the ones
  that appeared to install correctly initially.

- **Symptom:** A volume shows `robustness: degraded` for a long time
  after a node recovers from a brief outage, never returning to
  `healthy`.
  **Fix:** Check `[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) -n [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system get replicas.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io`
  for a replica stuck in a rebuilding or error state — a prolonged
  rebuild can be blocked by insufficient free disk space on the target
  node for the replacement replica, or a stale replica timeout setting
  too short/long for the actual rebuild time; check available disk
  space on candidate nodes before assuming the volume itself is broken.

- **Symptom:** A volume with `numberOfReplicas: 2` becomes `faulted`
  (no healthy replica) after a single node failure.
  **Fix:** Two replicas provide no tolerance once one is lost if the
  remaining replica's node also has any issue during the rebuild
  window — this is the expected (if painful) consequence of
  under-replicating a production volume. Restore from backup (step 8)
  for the immediate recovery, and change the StorageClass default to
  `numberOfReplicas: 3` going forward for anything at this criticality.

- **Symptom:** Backups appear to run successfully on schedule, but a
  test restore produces a volume that's missing recent data or fails to
  mount.
  **Fix:** This usually means the backup target's credentials or
  network path degraded silently (backups "succeeding" against a
  misconfigured/unreachable target can still report success in some
  failure modes, or point at the wrong bucket/path after a
  reconfiguration) — periodically perform an actual test restore (not
  just checking the "backup completed" status), the same discipline as
  the practice-restore guidance in
  [etcd-backup-restore-and-cluster-health](../[etcd-backup-restore-and-cluster-health](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/etcd-backup-restore-and-cluster-health/SKILL.md)/SKILL.md).

- **Symptom:** Someone deletes a PVC to "free up space" during
  cleanup, and the underlying [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) volume (and its replicas) is
  immediately and irreversibly deleted along with any data not yet
  backed up.
  **Fix:** This is a destructive action — set `reclaimPolicy: Retain`
  on any StorageClass backing data that matters, so a PVC deletion
  leaves the underlying volume/`PersistentVolume` intact for manual
  review rather than triggering immediate deletion, and confirm a
  recent backup exists before ever deleting a volume outright.

## Worked example

**Scenario:** Provide replicated block storage for a Redis cluster on a
5-node [bare-metal](../../../AI_and_Agents/Models_and_FineTuning/bare-metal/SKILL.md) cluster, with daily backups to S3, and validate
recovery after simulating a node failure.

```bash
[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)/[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)/v1.6.2/deploy/prerequisite/[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-iscsi-installation.yaml
helm repo add [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) https://charts.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io
helm install [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)/[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md) --namespace [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system --create-namespace --version 1.6.2
```

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata: { name: [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-redis }
provisioner: driver.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io
reclaimPolicy: Retain
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
  numberOfReplicas: "3"
  dataLocality: "best-effort"
```

```bash
[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) -n [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system patch settings.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io backup-target \
  --type=merge -p '{"value":"s3://[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-backups-example@us-east-1/"}'
[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) -n [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system patch settings.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io backup-target-credential-secret \
  --type=merge -p '{"value":"[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-backup-s3-secret"}'
```

```yaml
apiVersion: [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io/v1beta2
kind: RecurringJob
metadata: { name: redis-daily-backup, namespace: [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system }
spec: { cron: "30 1 * * *", task: "backup", groups: ["redis"], retain: 14 }
```

Redis's PVCs are labeled into the `redis` recurring-job group so the
nightly backup covers them automatically. To validate recovery, a
worker node is cordoned and powered off deliberately in a staging
cluster:
```bash
[kubectl](../../Containers_and_Orchestration/kubectl/SKILL.md) -n [longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)-system get volumes.[longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md).io -l longhornvolume=redis-data-0 -o jsonpath='{.status.robustness}'
# degraded
```
Within [Longhorn](../longhorn/SKILL.md)'s configured replica-rebuild window, a new replica is
scheduled on a healthy node and `robustness` returns to `healthy`
automatically — confirming the 3-replica configuration tolerates a
single node loss without needing to fall back to a backup restore at
all, which is the intended outcome for this failure class.
